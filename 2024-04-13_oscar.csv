 Ladies and gentlemen, please forgive me if my words are inadequate in thanking you for your very great kindness. If I were to mention all those who have shown me such wonderful generosity through ""Gone with the Wind"" I should have to entertain you with an oration as long as ""Gone with the Wind"" itself. So if I may, I should like to devote my thanks on this occasion to that composite figure of energy, courage, and very great kindness, in whom all points of ""Gone with the Wind"" meet -- Mr. David Selznick.

 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science[s], fellow members of the motion picture industry and honored guests. This is one of the happiest moments of my life, and I want to thank each one of you who had a part in selecting me for one of the awards for your kindness. It has made me feel very, very humble and I shall always hold it as a beacon for anything I may be able to do in the future. I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry. My heart is too full to tell you just how I feel. And may I say thank you and God bless you.

 Ladies and gentlemen, it's almost impossible to speak. You haven't been through this. It's alright up to that moment. What I want to do is say thank you to Darryl Zanuck, to John Ford, to Philip Dunne for the wonderful script, and for the opportunity to play such a wonderful part. I think there's quite a lot of the old timers knocking around that could do justice to some of that and some of you wonderful producers will look at some of these old timers and give 'em a chance. There's a lot of good blood there. I'm very thrilled, ladies and gentlemen, very honored, very grateful for this. And I do want to say that my little friend Barbara Stanwyck has been rehearsing me all week; she's handed me every lamp and statue on the set. So it was alright. Thank you again very, very much.

 I would like to say that first of all this is getting to be a habit of accepting awards that justly belong to Commander Ford. Commander Ford is missed greatly at 20th Century-Fox. But 20th Century-Fox is indeed proud of Commander Ford who is tonight on a ship somewhere in the Far East. And I'm sure that were he here he would congratulate all of the other nominees, and I am certain that he would feel that, again, he was very lucky. Thank you.

According to the highly personal quality of our business, I've always had the feeling ever since coming into it, that you can only be as good as the other fellow thinks you are, or, I might add, as bad.

 Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished visitors from the armed forces, Governor Warren, honored guests, Mr. Chairman – Mr. President Chairman: Thank you. That is really all there is to say; but, as this is after all the opportunity of a lifetime, I hope you won't mind if I try to expand that word just, just a little. This is, this is going to be a great evening to remember. We've had some very exciting messages and some very exciting speeches. It should make us all very proud to belong to this great and fascinating industry. Praise from our government and our armed forces and from abroad from our allies for work we have done should make us determined to carry on. We have somehow brought very wide horizons into this room tonight. Anything that I have to say now, which is practically unprepared... [camera cuts]

 As for the nominations, I've always felt that to be nominated simply means that you've had the great good luck to be entrusted with one of the best assignments of the current year, and that's a cause for rejoicing in itself. And there isn't a single good craftsman in this industry who if given such an opportunity can't be counted on to measure up to it. Why do we all long to win the award? It's no question of superiority because we're comparing different excellences and they're varied in their nature and they can't be fairly compared. There's no rivalry in this room tonight. There's no competition. As the Dodo said to Alice in Wonderland: ""Everybody has won and everybody shall have a prize."" The nominations are really the prizes. The award...I, I can hardly believe that it's really for me tonight. It's always seemed to me something very personal, a gesture from the men and women of this industry who choose to show not only recognition of, of work... [camera cuts]

 Ladies and gentlemen, I came to this country as a stranger five years ago. I've been very happy and very proud to be a member of this community and of this industry all that time. And from everybody I met or worked with truly I have received such ready kindness that for quite a long while I couldn't believe that it was true, but tonight you have made me feel that you have really set the door of your friendship wide open and that welcome is officially on the mat, and that is why I'm so happy. [camera cuts]

 ...very humbly, very gratefully I say thank you and I step across your threshold. There... [camera cuts]

I wished I had an Oscar to give you, but I can give you my blessings and tell you I'm proud to have you as my son and wish you all the continued happiness and the glories that'll be yours, because I've had mine. This industry's been awfully good to me, and may you follow in my footsteps and be greater than I ever was, which I'm sure you will be. Thank you. [camera cuts]

 I feel that this statuette should go to that grand artistic person who was the producer of that picture. He's not here tonight because it was necessary, most necessary, to have him sent away for a rest. The director received the award for the direction; and properly so. I think Mervyn should've had one, too, for ""Random Harvest."" [camera cuts]

 ...for the screenplay, the cameraman for the photography. And if Sidney was here, he'd say, ""Well, with such writers and an author who had a grand set of characters and a grand idea, with such direction, and with such stars and supporting cast, anybody could've done it."" I've been there, and I tell you that this statue should go to Sidney Franklin. Thank you.

But even in this wonderful moment my common sense reminds me quite clearly that most of the work that went into earning this award was not done by Olivia de Havilland at all, but by a big team of other people who, if justice were really to prevail, would be standing up here beside me now. When I think of the writer who created ""Jody Norris,"" and how much of her sprang from the heart and mind of the director. When I remember the businessmen who found and managed the money which produced her and distributed her. And how she grew under the talents and skills of the technicians: the cameraman, the makeup man, the hairdresser, the costumer. And then I think how much the musicians did for her. Then I feel humble too, as well as proud, to accept this award which I do in the name of my team as well as my own. Thank you.

 Whoow! Now I know there's a Santa Claus. Oh, you may laugh, ladies and gentlemen. It's not so easy to be certain, you know. He's a most elusive little fellow. He turns up in all sorts of places under all sorts of names and disguises. First time I ever met him he told me his name was George Seaton. And wonderfully, George Seaton has his revenge by bringing him to life. About a year and a half ago he suddenly turned up in Culver City and told me his name was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. That was the day Metro agreed to loan me to Fox to make the picture. And now I think it's time Santa Claus added a word to his name. I think he ought to call himself Santa Claus, Incorporated. Santa Claus, Inc. Inc.! For then he would embrace all you wonderful, kind people who have done me the honor of making me stand here tonight. Thank you, all of you, for making the evening of my life such a happy one. Thank you.

 [Taps three times on the microphone.] That's my heart. You know, up until now, presentations of the Academy Awards has been a purely spectator sport for me. However, tonight I, uh, dressed for the stage just in case.

 But in all honesty, I suppose I couldn't expect to be more elated than I was when I heard I was nominated, because I had seen and I knew the beautiful jobs done by the other four nominees: Rosalind's vitality and her great technical skill in bringing that classic character to life; Joan's expert craftsmanship in ""Possessed""; and the magic and delicacy that Dorothy McGuire brings to any role, and particularly in this one; and the superb artistry of Susan Hayward who succeeded in turning a very difficult characterization into an authentic character and a personal triumph. Yes, yes, I think my great thrill was when ""Katie"" was voted into that class. Course, we all know there wouldn't have been any ""Katie"" if it hadn't have been beautifully written and directed and photographed and... and magnificently produced by Mr. Dore Schary. For my part, I am thankful to have been in a picture that made so many people think fondly and possessively of their country, and of our industry that can give them those thoughts.

 And as for you [looking at Oscar], at long last! Good night and God bless you.

I can think of a lot of things I'd love to say and I couldn't say 'em in fifteen seconds. I would like to say this, because I hear a lot of kidding about what people say when they get one of these, but you do feel grateful to a few people that helped you to. And I would like to say to a man by the name of Darryl Zanuck, who's given me a couple pretty wonderful opportunities, to Henry King, a fine man and a great director, I'm very grateful.

 And the music, Fred. Can you hear that too?

 FRED ASTAIRE:
 Yes indeed I can, Ginger. And of course I, I, I just don't know what to say. It's wonderful. I'm so thrilled. I'm ready to do handsprings myself down Madison Avenue. I'm very proud and very grateful. And as for you, Ginger, you've been much too gracious. Remember, I've had a partner.

 GINGER ROGERS:
 Thanks, Fred, but that's not what it says here on the Oscar. It says in big letters: To Fred Astaire.

 FRED ASTAIRE:
 Now for goodness sakes, Ginger, don't let anything happen to it, will ya? I'll tell you what, I heard George Murphy on the show. If he's still in the house would you ask Murph to please accept the award for me. Thanks, Ginger. And God bless you all. Goodbye.

 Hello, ladies and gentlemen three thousand miles away. Hello, my dear, beloved Helen Hayes, how wonderful to hear your voice. And I know it's kind of conventional to thank people, but I'm gonna be conventional because I'm sincere. All of you who are connected with this picture – Stanley, Mike, Carl, Frank Planer, George, Mala, Bill Prince, Morris Carnovsky, all of you – you know as well as I do that it's your Oscar as much as it is mine. Also, to you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy who voted for me, you must know that this means more to me than just the honor accorded to an actor, and from the bottom of my heart I thank you for what I consider a vote of confidence and an act of faith. And believe me, I will not let you down. And one more thing. I think the most important winner of all tonight is the man with the long nose himself who has ridden victoriously through the pages of dramatic literature for over fifty years, and this is just the beginning for Cyrano de Bergerac. Thank you very much.

 HELEN HAYES [in Hollywood]:
 Joe, I'm taking your Oscar and I'm gonna hang on to it for you, and congratulations from us all.

Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He's one of the nicest fellows I know. I don't know anybody any nicer. And our kinship goes further than that friendship because we both fell off of horses into pictures together. Now that I'm through being such a good sport, spouted all this good sportsmanship, I'm gonna go back and find my business manager, and agent, and producer, and three-name writer, and find out why I didn't get ""High Noon"" instead of Cooper.

""Samson"", that showed the, that man's strength comes from above. And ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", which is a happy picture made to make people thrill and enjoy, and millions of kids all over the world who haven't even seen circuses respond. As Lincoln said to Barnum: Laughter is the best medicine.

 Now I understand that there are almost fifty million people listening, who are attending this ceremony tonight through television and radio. I want to thank them for the way they receive the motion picture industry as an art. The way they have stood by us and loved us. When we do good work they respond; when we do poor work they chastise us by their absence. Now I want to thank them personally for their reception, particularly – I'm going to be selfish – of these two pictures, these two dreams that were brought to life by so many people in this industry. By sharing those dreams they have brought me this award which I shall keep close to me all of my life. I'm very grateful. God bless you.

 Ladies and gentlemen, when the fat man with the derby hat and the tall, thin man with the sad face first came on the screen together, that was way back in 1926. They made the world laugh [for] 24 years. Twenty-four years. And they made us laugh because in them we kind of saw ourselves – ridiculous, frustrated, up to our necks in trouble, but nevertheless ourselves. Oliver Hardy delicately tipped his derby hat with his pudgy little fingers and left us a little while back. But the thin, sad-faced one, the one from whose fertile mind sprang many of the universally humorous notions that have been borrowed so freely by the comedians who have followed, he's still with us. Unhappily, he isn't well enough to be here with us this evening, but I'm very proud indeed to accept for him from the Board of Governors this award for ""creative pioneering in the field of comedy,"" presented to one of the really great men of our chosen profession, Mr. Stan Laurel.

 A few years ago I retired to a room on 58th Street in New York, and I retired there with some legal records of the Third Reich. And I went there because I believe that a writer who's worth his salt at all has an obligation not only to entertain but to comment on the world in which he lives. Not only to comment, maybe, but to maybe have a shot at reshaping that world. It's a long way from that room to this hall and I couldn't accept this without, without mentioning a couple of allies I'd picked up on the way. One, of course, is my brilliant mentor, Stanley Kramer; a man of courage, talent, and a man of his word. And probably the most gifted cast that a writer ever had in on a picture, to say thanks to you, Spence, Burt, Judy, Dick, Marlene, Max.

You've been so generous to me that I think the time has come for me to reveal the secret of my success in this field. And my advice to any aspiring young writer for the film medium is very simple: Just make sure that you write for either David Lean or Freddy Zinnemann.

 I've also got a couple of metaphorical Oscars of my own which I want to bestow. One to Bill Graf, our executive producer, who brought Freddy and myself together and suggested that we have a go at it. And the other one to Johnny Box, who on a pretty small budget created the mock-ups of various palaces and castles, inside and out, which were so good that I, I think in common with a lot of other people, when I first saw them on the rushes, thought they were the real thing. Thank you very much. I'm very proud to have this.

 I think you're applauding my stamina. [Banters with presenter Frank Sinatra.]

 I'm very grateful to the Academy's Board of Directors for this happy tribute and to Frank for coming here especially to give it to me. And well, to all the fellows who worked so hard in finding those and assembling those film clips.

 You know, I may never look at this without remembering the quiet patience of the directors who were so kind to me, who were kind enough to put up with me more than once, some of them even three or four times. There was Howard Hawks, Hitchcock, the late Leo McCarey, George Stevens, George Cukor and Stanley Donen. And all the writers. There was Philip Barry, Dore Schary, Bob Sherwood, Ben Hecht, dear Clifford Odets, Sidney Sheldon, and more recently Stanley Shapiro and Peter Stone. Well, I trust they, and all the other directors, writers and producers and leading women, have all forgiven me what I didn't know.

 I realize it's conventional and usual to praise one's fellow workers on these occasions, but why not?! Ours is a collaborative medium, we all need each other. That's how we exist. And what better opportunity is there to publicly express one's appreciation and admiration and affection for all those who contribute so much to each of our welfare. You know, I've never been a joiner or a member of any particular social set, but I've been privileged to be a part of Hollywood's most glorious era. And yet tonight, thinking of all the empty screens that are waiting to be filled with marvelous images and idealogies, points of view, whatever, and considering all the students who are studying film techniques in the universities throughout the world and the astonishing young talents that are coming up in our midst, I think there's an even more glorious era right around the corner.

 So before I leave you, I want to thank you very much for signifying your approval with this. I shall cherish it until I die, because probably no greater honor can come to any man than the respect of his colleagues. Thank you. So long.

I would hope that ""Patton"" is not just a war picture; I would hope it's a peace picture. Thank you very much.

1970,43,1971-04-15,Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,Gregory Peck,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Frank Sinatra,"FRANK SINATRA:
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Greg. This is truly an all-consuming thrill for me tonight. Over the years I've been part of the awards wearing many different hats – performer, emcee, presenter, recipient – but this is the top of the moment of my little walk-on in life, you might say. And I've been doing a little more thinking and contemplating these days than I did twenty-five years ago. That's because I'm what is known in the vernacular as a retired man now. You might have read about that in your neighborhood throw-aways.

 One of the things I've been thinking about is why you have to get famous to get an award for helping other people. I'm not being facetious about it; I've just been thinking about it. It's true, actually. If your name is John Doe and you work night and day doing things for your helpless neighbors, what you get for your effort is tired. So Mr. and Mrs. Doe and all of you who give of yourselves to those who carry too big a burden to make it on their own, I want you to reach out and take your share of this Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Because if I have earned it so, too, have you. In fact, your way of earning it was harder than my way. Show business has made it easier for me to spread a dab of sunshine here and there. I mean, in show business they pay quite well. And being the quiet, conservative man that I am, I have invested a chunk at 3 percent and put the dividends to work in that noblest of all causes: charity toward your fellow man. It's the only investment in the world that pays 100 percent dividend. Anyway, it's put a great big bundle in here [touches his heart] for me, and I'd like to thank my dear brothers and sisters of the Academy for this joyous moment. Thank you.

 I'm speechless. And there are only two words that I can say from my beloved sister and myself for this warm tribute from all my friends and all of you of the Academy: thank you. And all the charming ghosts I feel around me who should share this, it was our privilege for a little while to serve that beautiful thing, the film. And we never doubted for a moment that it was the most powerful thing, the mind and heartbeat of our technical century. I hope we served it well and I do thank you with all my heart for all of us that this represents. Good night.

1970,43,1971-04-15,Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,John Huston,Honorary Award,for superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures.,NA,NA,Orson Welles,"ORSON WELLES:
 Ladies and gentlemen, with this great honor may I say that it's a lot more fun to look forward. Looking backward over some thirty years in the movies is something that I like to do as seldom as possible, but I can't forget that I didn't spend those years alone. Every filmmaker knows how much was done for him and by how many. If I could call just half of all those who deserve it to stand beside me now in front of this camera, just to get 'em in one shot we'd need Cinerama. It'd be quite a crowd scene.

 As for the public, I hope that they will understand why this is the more precious just because it does not come to me from them, much less from the critics, but from movie people themselves, the ones who love movies most. We need the public; the public doesn't need us. That's the truth of it. We don't really fill a pressing popular need; we try to create it. And if we didn't love movies as much as we do, if we weren't a little crazy on the subject, there wouldn't be any movies at all. I treasure this award as an expression of this happy lunacy, and may I accept it, please, not so much for what I may have done as for what I hope to do. God willing I'm going to make some movies that deserve it. Meanwhile, this encouragement is very welcome. With all my heart, I thank you for it.

I met a lot of warm, generous people and I am very happy that Ingmar Bergman asked me to represent him on this big occasion, though I would have been more happy if he himself could have been here tonight getting personally all the respect and love which has been shown him. He has asked me to say to you that he is sitting on his little island in the Baltic writing on a new script. He isn't here because he feels that a long trip at this moment would do great harm to his concentration on work and he believes that he shows his respect and gratefulness to the honor bestowed to him by the Board and members of the Academy by staying home finishing his script. And he also feels that this fantastic award will inspire him in his fulfillment of his work. Ingmar Bergman says, ""I am deeply touched and very, very grateful.""

It was in New York, and the gentlemen sitting in front of us when we were doing that scene was my acting teacher, and I just have to mention his name: George Morrison. I want to thank him. Also, Mr. Billy Friedkin, who has already received his prize tonight, but I have to thank him because he really brought me through this when I wanted to quit. And Eddie Egan, who you all know.

I had a speech all rigged up for this but the more I worked on it the phonier it got, so, I'd like to mention some people that has made this all possible: Mr. Peter Bogdanovich, the director of ""The Last Picture Show;"" his lovely wife Polly; Mr. John Ford, who had a lot to do with my doing the show; the entire cast and crew; and all of the folks down in Anarene, Texas – I think they deserve a big mention; last but certainly not least, Columbia Pictures. Now, if you got a crew like that behind you, you can't be all bad. And now what I'm about to say probably will stir up a lot of conversation around over the country.

 I can't thank anybody. I feel that we all have, are part of each other. That we've all contributed. And we work together and we're all the same people. And I love you all for all the experiences I've had. Except that I want to say to Cornelia Williams Hurlbut, my first piano teacher, and Rose Lorenz, my dancing teacher in Des Moines, and my father Buck Leachman who paid the bills – wait – and finally my mother, whose imagination and funny sense of humor and almost Walter Mitty life herself led to all of this.

It was that very Oscar which marked the beginning of the global acceptance of that film which was produced against the advice of many. ""The Garden of Finzi Continis"" was made by Vittorio De Sica, Gianni Hecht Lucari and myself against similar advice. We were warned that a film without any sex and without any violence, dealing in a subtle manner with a tragic chapter of mankind is a doomed venture. Tonight, again, the Academy has given hope and inspiration to independent film producers everywhere to go ahead with their projects as long as they sincerely believe in them.

On behalf of my two partners, Gaby Monet who did the scenario, Robert Deubel who directed the film, our editor Burt Rashby, the lyrics of Fred Ebb and the music of John Kander.

 FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA:
 When I came here I was very nervous because I hadn't prepared anything to say should I come up here. And then after about forty minutes I thought of something to say but I started to get very nervous that I would never get to come up here to say it. And I've forgotten it, whatever it was.

 Firstly, I'd like to thank Peter Bart who was responsible for getting me this job in the first place, which sort of rescued me from my wonderful, romantic financial adventure in San Francisco, which still lives. And then, giving credit where it's due, I'd like to thank Bob Towne who wrote the very beautiful scene between Marlon and Al Pacino in the garden; that was Bob Towne's scene. And lastly, I would like to congratulate Bob Fosse. And also say that the best award a director could get would be to have three of his best friends and dear associates and actors – Jimmy Caan, Al Pacino and Bobby Duvall – all get nominated in the same category. Thank you very much.

 And of course I am profoundly grateful to the governors of the Academy. I was listening to his words back there, Frank, and I thought for a minute, someone out there'll think I was kind of special – far from it. You know the people of this nation have a golden tradition of taking care of each other. And across America right now there are men and women, countless numbers of them, young and old, who are giving of themselves to hospitals, to orphanages, to drug clinics, to youth, and even possibly watching a little child take her first steps after being crippled as I have watched. So the only unique thing about me tonight is that I am here with this, knowing that it belongs to so many others. I would also like to tell you that I have been the victim of this kindness, and I want to thank each and every one of them and all the letters that were sent to me over the years for all they did for me while I was not quite well. Thank you very much.

But naturally to Marty Ransohoff, and Filmways and Paramount. I am deeply indebted for them letting us even make the film, because nobody wanted to let us make it. To Steve Shagan and John Avildsen. It would take much too much and much too long and I'll have to do it personally later. And to a cast and a crew of people, I've never in my life been connected with anything that meant more to me and worked with so many wonderful professional people that cared and loved something so much. And they made it one of the great, great moments of my life, the making of that film, and that's equal to this honor, just the privilege of working with them, truthfully. And I thank them all and I love them and respect them.

 I just want to say one more thing. In recent years especially there has been a great deal of criticism about this award. And probably a great deal of that criticism is very justified. I would just like to say that whether it's justified or not, I think it is one hell of an honor and I am thrilled. And I thank you all very, very much.

 Well, around 1916 and 1917 in France, everyone who counted, or I should better say, all the really important artists in France, like Picasso and Proust and Diaghilev and Stravinsky, became crazy about the American cinema.

As you can see she is a considerate, sympathetic, unselfish and altogether beautiful human being. And so to Katharine Hepburn and all the great performing artists, men and women, upon whom I have depended; to those remarkably talented writers, directors, craftsmen; and to Louis B.

She gave the most beautiful performance that all we actresses recognized because, after all, we have all forgotten our lines and always open the wrong doors, and it was wonderful to see her do it so beautifully.

And when I heard it I said, at first, my God, to do a sequel to ""The Godfather"" is a sure-fire way to fail and blow everything I was lucky enough to get up to that point. And then I went home and I thought about it, and I realized that because it maybe was such an easy way to fail, which was probably the best reason to try to tackle what seems so impossible. And it's, I'm really happy I did. I just want to thank Gordie Willis who was the photographer, who did a beautiful job.

 Thank you so much. It's ironic, of course, to get a prize for a war movie while the suffering in Vietnam continues. But I feel very lucky that we have it and even luckier in our colleagues in filming, Dick Pearce, Tom Cohen and Brennon Jones, and in editing, Lynzee Klingman and Susan Martin, who deserve the award equally with Bert and me. Mostly, though, I have been blessed, and not just lucky, with the support and inspiration of my wife Johanna and with the patience of our sons who I hope will grow up in a country and atmosphere somewhat different from the one we had to portray in ""Hearts and Minds."" And who I hope will go to bed now. Thank you.

 BERT SCHNEIDER:
 First of all, I would like to say a special thank you to my late brother Stanley whose support and love and encouragement allowed us to make this film and all of the films that BBS made. It is ironic that we are here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated. I will now read a short wire that I have been asked to read by the Vietnamese people. It is sent by Ambassador Dinh Ba Thi, who is the chief of the Provisional Revolutionary Government's delegation to Paris, the Paris political talks. It says: ""Please transmit to all our friends in America our recognition of all that they have done on behalf of peace and for the application of the Paris Accords on Vietnam. These actions serve the legitimate interest of the American people and the Vietnamese people. Greetings of friendship to all the American people."" Thank you very much.

 JOHN WAYNE:
 Thank God.

 HOWARD HAWKS:
 And when he became sick and came to the desert to die, I used to go over and see him. We'd talk and laugh. Then we got to telling each other the things that we'd stolen from each other. And we often tried to remember all of the things I tried to, that I took from Ford and he did from me. One day he was laughing and he said, ""There's something I took from you that beats the whole thing."" He said, ""I made a picture that wasn't so good, and you made 'Sergeant York.'"" And he said, ""I got the award."" And he stopped in the middle of laughing and he changed – just as Duke knows and other people, he changed quickly. And he said, ""Well, you're gonna get an award."" And I said, ""I don't think so."" He said, ""Goddamn it! You're gonna get an award."" So I would like to thank the Academy for making that prediction of his come true. Thanks very much.

I was very fortunate to work with two fine actors like Walter Matthau and Dick Benjamin, and to be directed by Herb Ross, and a script by Neil Simon, and with a great producer like Ray Stark, and for a beautiful studio like MGM. And being surrounded by all that talent was a great break for a newcomer like myself.

After a preview that you'd go to, Irving would sit up with you upstairs at Metro and he'd say, ""I know what's good about the picture, tell me what's wrong about the picture."" And Irving never made a criticism about a movie unless he could improve it. That's the kind of a man he was. And this means so much to me that I can't tell you. He was quite a guy. I loved him. He was very close to me. I wish we had more Irving Thalbergs around today, but they're around and they'll come out, believe me.

 I want to thank the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for giving me this beautiful award, voting it for me, believing in me, because they've done so much for the world. And tonight I think they've done more for the world than ever by showing what Hollywood does and running all of these beautiful acts and beautiful scenes on Telstar, of which I am a stockholder. We were going to run some films tonight but they're a little late and I'm a little late and I'm a little nervous. And I want to thank you all and I love you all. And this means so much to me. Thank you.

 I want to say thanks to the members of the Academy and my husband. I wish he was here tonight to be with us all, but since he isn't here I'll always cherish this for him. And before he died he said to me, ""Darling, if I win I want to say thanks to my fellow actors who have given me encouragement over the years; and thanks to Paddy Chayefsky who have given him the part; and thanks to Barry who have tell us to come from Jamaica, to come and do this part."" And he says, ""Most of all, thanks to you, darling, for sending the right vibes the right way. And thanks, the members of the Academy Award."" Thank you all.

Though I should have known that when I had someone like Paddy Chayefsky writing and saying things that we all feel but can't express, and when we have someone like Sidney Lumet who makes one want to act forever, and a producer like Howard Gottfried, then how can I miss? But I know that my mother would be delighted. She had great potential for an actress but didn't think she should do it, so she pushed me and was delighted. And Michael Chekhov, the great actor and teacher who I studied with, who gave me a love and respect for the theater, which is the whole point of why we're all here. It's a great profession and we have to keep thinking it all the time. And we all do. And we all love it.

Ironically, all three films have in common that they were made against well-meant advice and that they were made without any commercial concessions or considerations whatsoever. I believe it is a tribute to the Academy that it has chosen ""Black and White in Color,"" a film entirely made in remote West Africa, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, a man who had never directed a feature film before, and played by a cast of excellent actors, albeit unknown.

The marvelous thing about this medium is that I could present my dreams as well as my feelings. I had nothing to lose so I played my hunches. A standard complaint of producers over the years has been that the studio ruined the picture or got me to change it, or the ads were lousy or the distributor didn't understand the film. In my case this wasn't so. The pictures that went out with my name -- good, bad or indifferent -- were produced by me. And when I knew what I wanted, and when I wanted it badly enough, I got it on the screen. My thanks to the Academy for not being indifferent and for forgetting the bad and remembering the good.

 About seven months ago Lloyd Leipzig of United Artists suggested I start preparing for this, and this afternoon I told Woody that if it happened I would try to be a little dignified. And he said I'd probably win an acting award if I could do it. Well, the truth is I'm not very prepared and I don't feel very dignified. But I want to say just a couple of things about how a filmmaker like Woody evolves. About seven years ago, David Picker brought us into United Artists with the simple words: Woody, do your thing. And through the years we have gotten nothing but support, encouragement, help and love from Eric Pleskow, Arthur Krim, Gabe Sumner and Danny Rissner. They've allowed Woody to mature into a fine filmmaker. This is truly an exciting night for all of us. I guess we all fantasize about something like this happening and now it's a reality. I'm very pleased. And thank you.

 JACK ROLLINS:
 I understand that Bob Hope had made a statement earlier today that Woody's nomination was gonna have some importance in bringing comedy forward in the Academy affairs. And if his winning tonight is another step in that direction, I'm delighted. I want to thank the members of the Academy for this great honor. Thank you.

And through the National Film Board it's been possible for many Canadian filmmakers, Americans, and people from all over the world to express themselves and put their feelings on film, express themselves culturally, pioneer in all kinds of animation and film techniques.

And then on April 4, April 3, he refuses to come out of his apartment. Thanks also to Gordie Willis for his wonderful photography; for Keaton, for obvious reasons–Diane, that is.

I don't think there's an actor here or watching this proceeding tonight who doesn't acknowledge a great debt to the continuing legacy of Laurence Olivier. And his presence here tonight has put a great perspective and just, on the proceedings for me, and a warm and generous and dignified one, and I'm not quite able to recover from it, I tell you.

 The performances this year in this category are remarkable, really. I am a great fan of the other members of the nominated body. And I know that we are all extremely aware of the extraordinary performances that we have been selected to represent. For my own part I have, as we all do, many people to thank for a performance which stands among this group of performances. I would like to thank everyone, but I select to thank a few who represent the many.

 I would like to thank Bruce Dern, my friend, for his encouragement and his wonderful performance, and his friendship. I would like to thank Jerry Hellman, who produced also ""Midnight Cowboy;"" is an extraordinary man, a great producer, a tenacious fighter, who keeps us all healthy and has great taste. I would like to thank Hal Ashby, a remarkable, a remarkable person who was so helpful in getting me to myself and encouraging my performance. And finally I would like to thank Jane, whose great dignity as a human being – it's a good thing she's not here to see this – is very moving to me. And finally, I'm carrying with me all the men who gave me so much of their experience to deal with, who have contributed so much: the people in chairs, and the veterans, and the civilians, and the walkers, who are so strongly represented in what I'd call my work.

 I'm so proud and grateful. It's been almost eight years.

In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing. And he led us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us. And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much. And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch. And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors.

 Thank you, Jack, for your gracious introduction and remarks. I am indeed overwhelmed by this prestigious, meaningful award. I thank each and every member of the Academy and the Board of Directors for the honor being bestowed upon me tonight. I appreciate the support given to me by my colleagues and associates at Columbia Pictures. I also take this opportunity to publicly thank my gracious wife Anita, my children and grandchildren for their understanding and constant support, and often sacrifices, in enabling me to participate in this work that is so dear to me.

 While our vast audience throughout the world looked to our industry to provide entertainment, it is important to stress the fact, often overlooked, that all segments of the industry are responsible people who are very responsive to the communal needs and other problems that confront us. They give generously of their time, talents and efforts, and financial resources to many worthwhile causes, be they philanthropic, civic or educational, that will help improve the quality of life. I am proud to be part of an industry that does so much for so many. Thank you all for making it such a memorable evening for me.

But the mere fact of it, the prodigal, pure, human kindness of it must be seen as a beautiful star in that firmament which shines upon me at this moment, dazzling me a little, but filling me with warmth and the extraordinary elation, the euphoria that happens to so many of us at the first breath of the majestic glow of a new tomorrow.

 Thank you. [Inspects the Oscar.] He has no genitalia and he's holding a sword. I'd like to thank my parents for not practicing birth control.

 I'm up here with mixed feelings. I've been critical of the Academy, and for reason. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be able to work. I am greatly honored for being chosen by the producer, Stanley Jaffe, and the director, Bob Benton, and to have worked in a family with them, and with Meryl and with Justin, who if he loses again we'll have to give him a lifetime achievement award. And to Jane Alexander and to Jerry Greenberg and to Néstor and to the crew on the film who was part of that family. And to the crew and to the directors like Bob Fosse and Mike Nichols and John Schlesinger that I've worked with before. We are laughed at when we are up here, sometimes, for thanking. But when you work on a film you discover that there are people who are giving that artistic part of themself that goes beyond a paycheck, and they are never up here. And many of them are not members of the Academy, and we never hear of them. But this Oscar is a symbol, I think, and it is given for appreciation from those people whom we never see. They are part of our life.

 I refuse to believe that I beat Jack Lemmon, that I beat Al Pacino, that I beat Peter Sellers. I refuse to believe that Robert Duvall lost. We are a part of an artistic family. There are sixty thousand actors in this Academy – pardon me – in the Screen Actors Guild, and probably a hundred thousand in Equity. And most actors don't work, and a few of us are so lucky to have a chance to work with writing and to work with directing. Because when you're a broke actor you can't write; you can't paint; you have to practice accents while you're driving a taxi cab. And to that artistic family that strives for excellence, none of you have ever lost and I am proud to share this with you. And I thank you.

 Oh, I'm gonna be the one to cry tonight, I'll tell you right now. They said this couldn't be done.

 ""Norma Rae"" was a real gift to me. It was given to me by Laddie and Jay and Gareth of the old Fox. It was given to me by Alex Rose and Tamara Asseyev, who fought very hard to get it made. It was given to me by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. And it truly was a gift, every single word. It was given to me by John Alonzo, who followed me around with a camera and never hoped to shine himself, just gave it all to me. It was given to me by the actors, especially Beau Bridges and Ron Leibman, whose real craft and talent and love and support is why I'm here.

 And mostly it was given to me because of Marty Ritt. Marty Ritt is ""Norma Rae."" He has fought all his life to put on films that are courageous, that say things, that are part of him that he feels should be said, that have the box-office potential of seventy-five cents, sometimes less. And I thank him for that. He's taught me a lot. And the best gift that Marty gave me was that he let me feel all the time that I was doing it myself, and I know that I didn't.

 And on a personal note, I'd like to thank my mother and my sister for holding me together and just plain old holding me. And my kids, Peter and Eli, for being my constant inspiration, and no matter how many awards I win, if it weren't them I wouldn't be worth a damn. Thank you very much.

 So what's a nice Jewish boy from Queens doing in a place like this? This is a great personal honor for me and it's particularly wonderful because it's associated with a film of which I feel so very proud. ""Best Boy"" took three-and-a-half years to make but it was very much a labor of love. And it tells the story of my fifty-two-year-old cousin Philly, who's mentally retarded, and his parents who are near eighty and about how he finally comes to separate from them as their lives end and his life has to go on. The film has been seen mainly on the East Coast, and with documentaries it's not always easy to get people to come and see the film. And if this award will help more people to come and see it then it will really be doing its job.

 I want to thank the Association for the Help of Retarded Children in New York City for their support of the film and for the wonderful work they did with Philly. I want to thank the entire crew, but in particular Tom McDonough, director of photography, who gave his sensitivity and intelligence and understanding and made the film much more than it would have otherwise been. I want to thank my cousins Frances and Norman, my aunt and uncle who are no longer alive, my aunt Pearl, my uncle Max. And most of all I want to thank my cousin Philly who gave me the opportunity to do the most important thing I've ever done in my life and who has continually reminded me how very delicate and beautiful any single human life can be. Thank you.

But I don't think I will ever have time to get over my amazement and my delight. There isn't time for me to thank everyone – directors, writers, fellow actors – who've made my life such a happy one, including those wonderful Hollywood stars who were my heroes when I was a youth.

 You know, when I was a drama student forty-seven years ago, I think, there used to be a formidable lady who came to take classes of what she called ""film technique."" And she arrived with a large wooden frame about four-foot square which she placed in front of our faces saying it was a close-up. And then she barked at us: Show fear, anger, joy, despair. And I quickly learned how to get maybe a laugh or two out of my fellow students. And then it dawned on me that, if I was seriously going to have a career in movies, the wisest thing was to do absolutely nothing at all. And that is more or less what I've done since then.

 First of all, to encounter the miracle of modern China through the musical vitality—musical genius and youthful vitality of Isaac Stern is an experience equaled only by receiving this award. There are a few people I must thank, and too few in the time we have. First and foremost, the executive producer Walter Scheuer, who had the vision not only to initiate the project but the courage to finance it, and that took a lot of courage because it was a long and complex project. Allan Miller, Tom Haneke and the editorial crew who so beautifully completed the film. The location crew who, challenged by what they saw in China, worked with me unceasingly from dawn until midnight throughout the length of the production. But most of all I would like to thank the Chinese people who greeted us so warmly and allowed us to film what for them was unusual in such an open and frank way.

 In the face of so much senseless violence in the world I hope that this vote is a vote not only for the film, but for a process: the fellowship—communication through the fellowship of music which imparts harmony into the human heart rather than violence. And I hope that this and I believe it can contribute in some way towards our living together peacefully both as neighbors and as nations. Thank you.

 Oh, Dad, I'm so happy and proud for you. My father didn't really believe that this was going to happen but he told me a while back that if it did he wanted his wife Shirlee to accept the award for him. But Shirlee wanted to be with him tonight, as is her way, and so I'm here.

 And first and foremost I want to thank on behalf of my father the members of the Academy who voted to give him this award. I know that he's watching right now and I know that he's very, very honored and very happy and surprised. And I'll bet when he heard it just now, I bet he said, ""Hey, ain't I lucky?"" As though luck had anything to do with it. I know also that he has tremendous respect for the other actors that were nominated and has always felt a little strange about these things, these competitions, because it's like comparing apples and oranges, and he feels very proud to have been among such a wonderful group.

 And I know that he feels that he would never have won this if it hadn't been for Katharine Hepburn. And if ""On Golden Pond"" is one of the highlights of his life, one of the main reasons is because of her, having the chance to work with her and to become her friend. And I know that one of the other reasons that he feels the film was so special is because of the quality of the crew. Every one of them, many of whose talents have been recognized tonight in the nominations. And the wonderful cast: Dougie McKeon, Dabney Coleman, Bill Lanteau, me—he's a proud father. The man who pulled us all together, our producer Bruce Gilbert. He is, my father is so happy, he feels so fortunate to have been able to play the role of ""Norman Thayer,"" a character that he loves a lot and understands very well. And for this he'd like to thank the sensitive man who wrote the words, who's already been honored tonight, Ernest Thompson. And for the tremendous talent and guidance of our director Mark Rydell, he's very, very grateful. We all became like a family during the filming and we sort of stayed together since. People call him up and stay in touch and come to visit him, and so it's like we've stayed a family, and it's made my father very, very happy. And he wants to thank Marble Arch and Universal for their support of the movie ""On Golden Pond.""

 He also feels very lucky to have been able to spend a summer in such a beautiful part of our country, northern New Hampshire, and he wants to thank all the people there who were so friendly and welcoming to us. And he was very happy, and so was I and are we, to have had our two families together, the Haydens and the Fondas, on the beautiful shores of that lake so that we could get to know each other even more. He wishes my brother Peter were here tonight, but Peter is somewhere in the jungles of the Philippines in front of a camera right now, like a good Fonda. And I know that lastly, but really first, he is thanking Shirlee Fonda who has been his loving support for seventeen years, who he calls his Rock of Gibralter. I think she's his ""Ethel Thayer."" Dad, me and all the grandchildren are coming over with it right away. Thank you.

And I think that it reflects more particular credit on the freedom of expression that we have in our American society and the lack of censorship that we have from the government or the people who put up the money.

My thanks to Frank Marshall, our producer, and our executive producer Howard Kazanjian, and to my terrific English and Hollywood assistants, and of course to my patient family. Finally, I'm extremely happy that the editing contribution on ""Raiders"" has played an important part in your enjoyment of the movie. Thank you for this wonderful honor.

 Ladies and gentlemen, this should be not a moment for regret in any sense, but I have to say that I have the regret that my late partner Moti Kothari, to whom this film was dedicated, is not here to share this award with me. And to his widow Dorothy, and Shanta and Rajni, I send my love and my very grateful thanks for the fact that their father gave me the idea of making this film.

 Members of the Academy, you have honored, you have seen fit to honor a number of people who have been connected with this film -- Jack and Ben and Billy, and many others. And particularly without Jack and Ben there would have been no movie. But I'm sure that they would agree that the person whom you really honor, as Ben suggested, was Mahatma Gandhi himself. He was an inspiration to millions and millions of people, and the extraordinary thing always seems to me, that he is currently still an inspiration. Your great folk hero Martin Luther King, Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. Lech Walesa, that noble Polish patriot, came out of prison the other day and said that what he had been attempting to do in the past was not going to work. The only way in which we could find human dignity and peace was through the philosophies and teachings of Gandhi.

 Gandhi simply asked that we should examine the criteria by which we adjudge the manner of solving our problems. That surely in the 20th century we human beings searching for our human dignity could find other ways of ultimately solving our problems than blowing the other man's head off. He begged us to re-examine that criteria. He believed that if we would but agree, simplistic though it be, that we would not resort to violence in the ultimate. Then the route that we would take in solving our problems would be a quite different one to the one that we accept now in the acceptance of ultimate confrontation. He begged us to re-examine that criteria. I believe he had something to say to all of us everywhere in the world.

 And dear colleagues, in all truth -- because the films that were nominated with me all wished for the same thing, all their makers wanted to say the same thing -- and in all truth it is not me or even Ben or Jack or Billy that you truly honor. You honor Mahatma Gandhi and his plea to all of us to live in peace.

And Jenny and Mark Sullivan back in Columbia, South Carolina, who's waited up in hope to see their granddaddy tonight. Time to go to bed, kids. Thank you.

 On an April day in 1951, my third day as a messenger at Warner Bros. Studios, I was riding my bicycle like the wind with a load of call sheets in the basket. And as I rounded the old First National cutting rooms I took my first meeting with a major studio executive. I ran over Jack L. Warner on my bicycle. I helped Mr. Warner to his feet, dusted his jacket off, and saw a three-day career flash before my eyes. Mr. Warner said, when he had collected himself, ""Son, if you want to stay in this business, stay off the bicycle."" Well, I took his advice and here I am.

 Ladies and gentleman, members of the Academy, the Board of Governors, I should like to share this great honor with my associates David Pettijohn, Lou Edemann, Rick Franklin, Sam Crutcher, Norman Schwartz, John Roesch, Joan Rowe, Chuck Neely, and of course Ben Burtt. And we should like to salute Steven Spielberg, Kathy Kennedy, and our beloved Carol Littleton. Thank you. Thank you very much.

 I'd like to also mention the unique contributions of Pat Welsh in the sounds of ""E.T."" and about twenty other people and animals which contributed noises: Cathy* and Shawn Summers* for their sick breathing, and various otters and horses and things that we recorded to use in the film. And I'd like to thank Gary Summers, my assistant at Lucasfilm, for his companionship and technical help. Thanks a lot.

 I wrote a long movie, I'm gonna make a long speech. Ah, no. Like everybody who stands up here I've got a lot of debts; I just want to acknowledge three. One to Dickie, Sir Richard, for having the faith and courage to trust me with his dream, put up with me once it became mine too, and fulfilling both our dreams with such brilliance and honesty. And to Ben, for a performance that went beyond dreams. For me it's still emotional to watch Ben although I've seen it like fifty or sixty times. I think it's so moving and so profound that it does an honor to our whole industry and justice even to the man that inspired the whole film.

 And then I would like to thank Gandhi himself. When I came to this material I despaired for it as drama and I didn't think it had much relevance in a world as cruel and as harsh as ours. But as I came to know the man I found that he knew everything we all know about our cruelty, our selfishness, our greed, our fears. But he also had a faith in the kind of stubborn resolution that we all have to be a little humane, to be a little understanding, to be a little, even, brotherly. And he lived his life in a way that showed that if we called upon that in ourselves and in our enemies, that there was hope for each of us and maybe for this planet. He gave me that. I tried in writing the screenplay to give it back in a way that he would have approved. I thank him. I thank you.

 Thank you, Chuck. I have worked in the motion picture industry my entire adult life. I've been privileged to know and collaborate with a remarkable group of people. I produced pictures of which I am very proud and I'm preparing exciting and challenging new ones. The Academy honored me some five years ago with the Thalberg Award, and now this. In short, this industry has been exceedingly good to me. It has provided me with the opportunity to realize many of my most deeply felt creative and professional aspirations.

 A natural extension of those involvements has been the acceptance of some of the responsibilities of good citizenship. It's been a privilege for me to participate in various professional, cultural and welfare activities of this industry and this community. I'm grateful for the opportunities that have been accorded for me to serve and I enjoy the fulfillments and the friendships they've brought me. I recommend them to others.

 Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Academy, this is for sixty years of work, so they tell me. It's really only for six minutes of fun, of love and joy, of working with, playing with, like children, the people that we all are on the screen. I love every minute that God has given me to be an infinitesimal small part of this great business. Sixty years, gosh, I... Tonight for my being here, and the responsibility really belongs to somebody that I'd love to put my arms around, like Judy Garland, and Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, Spencer Tracy, Wallace Beery. Memories, I have a lot of memories, as we all do.

 When I was nineteen years old I was the number one star of the world, for two years. When I was forty, nobody wanted me. I couldn't get a job. And then a professor from the University of Tennessee got a show together with Terry Allen Kramer and Harry Rigby called ""Sugar Babies,"" and it resurrected my career. Last year God smiled upon me and I was given the Emmy for ""Bill,"" and I won the Peabody Award and the Golden Globe, and tonight you honor me beyond anything that a man should be given. You honor me with the greatest and the highest tribute we can receive in our business.

 My family all love you and they're all tingling inside because of this moment for me. I'd love to even kiss Louis B. Mayer. But it's, it's wonderful. The woman who put it all together was Ruth Webb, my agent, who picked up the pieces and put 'em back together. Mickey, Jr., Timmy, Teddy, Kelly, Kerry, Kyle, Kimmy Sue, Jimmy, Jonell, Chris and Mark, and my grandchildren, my grandchildren Shannon and Nika*. They're home tonight looking and saying, ""That's Granddaddy up there, and he's got the Oscar."" But the one that's responsible, outside of God, is my wife Jan, who kept saying to me for the last seven years, ""I know you can do it, Mick. Get up off the canvas. You can do it."" I want to thank you, one and all, for remembering me. Thank you for this glorious moment. God bless and good night.

 Thank you very much. I'm very excited, very happy, very moved, very everything tonight, to be up here, to be singled out from among all these very talented people. I sometimes come to the Academy Awards and watch them year after year, and I get caught up in the spectacle of it, in the event, in the very complex type of entertainment and I guess, I know I forget, that what we're really here for is to single out who we think is the best for that given year. And if that's what I am to be this year then I appreciate it. I accept it with an honor and I'm very moved because of that.

 I think we set out to make a film, a very truthful film, a very good film. I think Bruce Beresford, Horton Foote, the Hobels, EMI, should all be commended for a very wonderful job that they did in putting this film together. I think it's a valid film, valid enough that we have gotten very much applause of a certain kind from certain members of the country western community, such as my friend Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings. And this is certainly a very high level of criticism coming from those people. And if I didn't have that on one hand, I would feel that this on the other hand was not complete. But the combination of both tonight makes this a very complete and exciting evening for me tonight. And I want to thank the Academy very much for this award. I'm very happy. Thank you.

It's nice when you...the producer and the director and the writers are all one man -- Jim Brooks. He did everything for us on ""Terms of Endearment,"" including writing eleven versions of this speech. I was gonna say a lot about how much Shirley and Debra inspired me, but I understand they're planning an interpretive dance number later, right after the Best Actress award, explain everything about life.

 I'm gonna cry because this show has been as long as my career. I have wondered for twenty-six years what this would feel like. Thank you so much for terminating the suspense. Oh my, I am nervous.

 I'm not going to thank everybody I've ever met in my entire life -- although, with the way my mind has been going lately probably everybody I've ever met in my entire life and in the other life I might have had had something to do with this. You know, if ""Terms of Endearment"" had happened to me five years ago, I think I would have called it a thrilling, commercial, artistic accident. But I don't believe that anymore. I don't believe there's any such thing as accident. I think that we all manifest what we want and what we need. I don't think there's any difference really between what you feel you have to do in your heart and success. They're inseparable.

 Jim Brooks deeply wanted to make a film about the defects and imperfections and foibles of people in a humorous and loving way. And he had such passion. It was unbelievable to watch. He's being very modest with himself tonight. It was unbelievable. His sense of truth was so accurate that he overwhelmed his own insecurities, and Paramount's. I guess we all did the same thing.

 I have wanted to work with the comic chemistry of Jack Nicholson since his chicken salad sandwich scene in ""Easy Pieces."" And to have him in bed was such middle-aged joy. I wanted to work with the turbulent brilliance of Debra Winger. She literally inhabited the character so thoroughly that I thought for four months I had two daughters.

 But in the end just let me say one thing. Films and life are like clay waiting for us to mold it. And when you trust your own insides, and that becomes achievement, it's a kind of a principle that seems to me is at work with everyone. God bless that principle. God bless that potential that we all have for making anything possible if we think we deserve it. I deserve this. Thank you.

1983,56,1984-04-09,Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,Frank Sinatra,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,M. J.,NA,NA,Frankovich,"M. J. FRANKOVICH:
 Thank you, Frank. This is a great honor for me, and to receive it from Frank Sinatra makes it a little more special. And I'm deeply appreciative to the Motion Picture Academy and its Board of Governors for choosing me to join such illustrious company as Frank Sinatra and the other past winners of the Jean Hersholt Award. Each of them has been a beacon to the rest of us in the motion picture industry and we have all gained in stature through their generosity, their caring, and their concern.

 As I stand here tonight, I can't help but think that I lived and was brought up just a couple of blocks from here. I sold newspapers down the street on the corner of First and Broadway. I also think of all the people in our profession who I have learned from and who have helped me along the way. There was Doug Fairbanks, Sr. who gave me my first job in the motion pictures. And I was nine years old and I played a choirboy in a picture called ""Rosita."" Doug Fairbanks was a man who cared about kids and I liked him for that. I learned even more about caring and loving children from Joe E. Brown who was like a second father to me.

 I owe a lot to my dear friend Leo Jaffe who brought me into the Columbia Pictures and who showed me that even when running a big company there was always enough time to help someone who needed help. And for my years in England I shall always remember the shining example from Lord Louis Mountbatten. I saw how much he loved children. I saw it first in India, in China, and during World War II. I saw it afterwards in the East End of London. And I learned what it meant to be gracious and to be compassionate from a beautiful actress, a beautiful star, and my leading lady for forty-four years, Binnie Barnes.

 I would like to share this award with each of these people who I've spoken about who meant so much to me with all of you in the entertainment industry, especially the men and women of the Variety Clubs International, the greatest children's charity in the world. Thank you. Thank you very much.

1983,56,1984-04-09,Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,"Jackie Cooper, George ""Spanky"" McFarland",Honorary Award,", in recognition of his unparalleled record of distinguished contributions to the motion picture art form.",NA,NA,Hal Roach,"HAL ROACH:
 Oh really, this is the nicest thing that has ever happened to me.

 GEORGE ""SPANKY"" McFARLAND:
 Well, the nicest thing that ever happened to me, Mr. Roach, was when you hired me fifty-two years ago. But there was something that I never did ask you. What was Hollywood really like out here in 1912?

 HAL ROACH:
 Oh, 1912. The first day that I worked in motion pictures I received a dollar a day, car fare and lunch. The car fare was two tokens, from in front of the post office downtown to Hollywood, one to take you there and one to bring you back to Los Angeles. The lunch was two sandwiches and a banana. And that is a little start of the 1912 business.

 But I understand the thing has grown a little more expensive today and people are trying a little harder to save money in making pictures. And they're doing a lot of things to try to curtail the expense. And the only thing I can add to that is my experience in those days as far as making pictures were concerned.

 For example, when a comedian for Mack Sennett did a ""Brodie"" or fell on his rear, he fell on a cake of soap or a pile of oil or something like that, or something else, but anyway -- I got all screwed up to start with. I meant to say pratfall to start with. But anyway, the Hal Roach Studios did it a different way. You remember I said two sandwiches and a banana? Well, the property man after lunch would pick up all the banana skins and put 'em away for safekeeping. Then anytime that a Hal Roach comedian did a pratfall he slipped on the banana peel. And they slipped many times, and every time they did we used another thing. But the thing that was great about it was the fact that the bananas didn't cost me anything.

 Just one thing in conclusion and that is this, that all these talented people that have been winning Oscars here tonight, they all make their money in an old-fashioned way. They earn it!

 You know, it's easy to gamble everything when you've got nothing to lose, and Milos Forman had a great deal to lose when he gave these brilliant roles to Tom Hulce and me. And his courage became my inspiration. There's only one thing that's missing for me tonight and that is to have Tom Hulce standing by my side.

 A while ago I was sitting in a theater watching one of my movies next to a friend of mine who is a film director. And after about an hour he touched me on the arm and said, ""That's beautiful, you're very clever."" So I explained that it was a second-unit shot. So perhaps I think it's best if I point out that the, all of the flying material was shot by Peter Allwork and the animal photography was Simon Trevor. I'm truly honored and very flattered, and thank you very much.

 Thank you very much. Frank Price made this film possible. He had the courage when it mattered the most and was easy to say no. I knew it was impossible to get a screenplay from this material so I didn't try; Kurt Luedtke didn't know it was impossible and so he did it. David Rayfiel kept us honest. Meryl, Bob, Klaus and Malick brought those characters to life and made an incredible world. All of us being helped all the time by Terry Clegg who kept us going. I had a team of editors who locked themselves in a room with me seven days a week, twelve hours a day and behaved as though nothing else in the world existed. John Barry made it all sing. Karen Blixen lived that life and turned it into art and taught a generation a new way to write prose. My wife Claire gave me more encouragement than I have any right to have, put up with more, was more tolerant. I'm indebted to all of them. I can't leave this podium without saying, I could not have made this film without Meryl Streep. She is astounding personally, professionally, in all ways, and I can't thank her enough. Thank you.

But in any case, I never dreamed of receiving such a wonderful honor during my lifetime, and I think this is the nicest and most pleasant way of getting the Oscar. I'm deeply moved, appreciative, and grateful to the Academy and especially those members of the music branch who have been supportive all these years.

 Since I have always believed that cinema is the great communicator, I am that much more thankful for the unique experience and satisfaction of having been able to work in this medium. It also offered the added inspiration of collaborating with some of the greatest authors and playwrights and directors of this century, some here tonight but time doesn't allow me to recognize them. In composing music for film I attempt to achieve the following goals: To meet the demands and needs of the story conflict and the interrelationship of the characters involved, and also, hopefully, contributing my own personal comment.

 I would like to make a humble plea to all of us involved in the movies, and that is to encourage and convey hope, humor, compassion, and adventure, and love, as opposed to despair, synthetic theatrics, and blatant, bloody violence. And sex, sex, sex, by all means, indeed, but with a bit of mystery, a touch of charm and elegance, and lots of imagination. Thank you.

 In accepting this award I salute the same unsung heroes that you so boldly have chosen to applaud. Some are with us today and some are not. Many have suffered and even died for this music, this greatest of all expression of the creative spirit of humankind—jazz. From their suffering and pain we can learn that life is the subject, the story that music so eloquently speaks of, and it is not the other way around. We as individuals must develop our lives to the fullest, to strengthen and deepen the story that others can be inspired by life's song.

 I thank Bertrand Tavernier, Irwin Winkler, Francis Paudras, Dexter Gordon, Bruce Lundvall, William Flageollet and the cast and crew for their sincere efforts through love and respect for this American-born art form called jazz.

 Thank you very much. I am deeply grateful. My profound thanks to John Daly and Derek Gibson for sharing my passion for this property and giving me the money to make it when all others passed. And thanks also to Gerald Green and Orion Pictures and Vestron Video and Garth Drabinsky for their support. And Richard Soames, for the completion guarantee. And Frans Afman of Credit Lyonnais, for having the money in the Philippine jungle when I really needed it. And to some other people [pulling out his notes]...Arthur Manson, and Marion Billings, and Andrea Jaffe. And to my wife Anne, who has been my business partner for sixteen years and has been with me every step of the way. And to our children, Peter, Evan and Stephanie, for urging me to make ""Platoon"" because their generation wanted to know more. And to Dale Dye and the entire cast and crew of ""Platoon,"" for their dedication. And particularly Oliver Stone, for his brilliance. I would not be here tonight but for Oliver Stone's brilliance, and I thank you, Oliver.

 The power of the motion picture medium is awesome. ""Platoon"" has brought to this generation a new perspective of war: That war is not glamorous, that it maims and it kills. And if perhaps ""Platoon"" could also influence people in this and other countries of the world to hesitate before they engage in war, to demand facts and ask questions before the bombs, then we, not just those of us that made ""Platoon"" but the entire motion picture industry, will have succeeded beyond our wildest imagination. Thank you so very much. I will treasure this [holding up his Oscar] forever.

But I can tell you that if she was here tonight and not absolutely one-half way around the world, she'd be up here in a flash to get this award. She's, I think, a bit too self-effacing to want me to deliver a sermon on the importance of a writer's contribution to films, but I think she'd allow me to say as a director that the best acting, the most brilliant photography, and the most wonderful sets and costumes add up to absolutely nothing, as we all know, without a good script. And I also want to say that I thank her for this one. Finally, I know she'd want me to salute E. M. Forster for her, for his ideas and his words. Thank you very much.

1986,59,1987-03-30,Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,Richard Dreyfuss,Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,,NA,NA,Steven Spielberg,"STEVEN SPIELBERG:
 I'm resisting like crazy to use Sally Field's line from two years ago.

 Thank you very much. Following in the footsteps of some of my heroes, Cecil B. De Mille and George Stevens, Alfred Hitchcock, William Wyler, Ingmar Bergman and Robert Wise, this award is truly a great honor for me. The Thalberg Award was first given fifty years ago in 1937, which was the year of ""In Old Chicago,"" ""Captains Courageous,"" ""Dead End,"" ""The Life of Emile Zola,"" ""Lost Horizon,"" ""Stage Door"" and ""A Star Is Born""—all having been nominated for Best Picture that year. I'm told Irving Thalberg worshipped writers. And that's where it all begins. That we are first and foremost storytellers, and without, as he called it, ""the photoplay,"" everybody is simply improvising. He also knew that a script is more than just a blueprint. That the whole idea of movie magic is that interweave of powerful image and dialogue and performance and music that can never be separated, and when it's working right, can never be duplicated or ever forgotten.

 I've grown up—most of my life has been spent in the dark watching movies. Movies have been the literature of my life. The literature of Irving Thalberg's generation was books and plays. They read the great words of great minds. And I think in our romance with technology and our excitement at exploring all the possibilities of film and video, I think we've partially lost something that we now have to reclaim. I think it's time to renew our romance with the word. I'm as culpable as anyone in having exalted the image of the word at the expense of...exalting the image at the expense of the word. But only a generation of readers will spawn a generation of writers.

 The five films nominated for Best Picture this year are as much the writer's film as the director's. And it's good news that each of these films has found its audience. Because this audience, who we all work for, deserves everything we have to give them. They deserve that fifth draft, that tenth take, that one extra cut and those several dollars over budget. And Irving Thalberg knew that. He would have been proud to have been associated with any of these films, as I am proud to have my name on this award in his honor. Because it reminds me of really how much growth as an artist I have ahead of me in order to be worthy of standing in the company of those who have received this before me. So my deepest thanks to the Board of Governors of the Academy and the audience out there in the dark. Thank you very much.

 Thank you. Thank you all very much. I really want to thank the actors branch of the Academy first, for just being a nominee with four actors that I really admire, and at least one that I consider a really good friend who I admire. And thank you for that. And for this fellow [the Oscar] from all of the Academy, I just want to share it with all the good work that was done by all the branches, whether you were nominated or not tonight, but this is all with you.

 A large part of this award belongs to Oliver Stone. And not only as the director, but having the courage to cast me in a part that not many people thought I could play. So I'll always be eternally grateful to him for that. And as a writer, Oliver, with Stanley Weiser, wrote a part that was the best part that I've ever had in my career. To Charlie and Martin Sheen, two wonderful actors that happen to be father and son, I thank them all very much for their help. Ed Pressman, Alex Ho, our producers; Leonard Goldberg, Scott Rudin, Tom Sherak of Fox, I thank you, too.

 I'd like to dedicate this award to William Darrid, Diana Douglas-Darrid, Anne Douglas and Kirk Douglas, my parents and step-parents, who have been extremely supportive and loving to me over the years. And in particular to my father, who I don't think ever missed one of my college productions, for his continued support and for helping a son step out of his shadow. I'll be eternally grateful to you, Dad, for that. Finally, to my wife Diandra and all my old friends who are smiling with me tonight, thank you. And to all you movie buffs, I just really appreciate, for making this a wonderful moment for me. Thank you. And good night, Cameron. I love you.

And I just realized myself the other day that my first, one and only attendance was thirty years ago. Patience truly is a virtue. But in winning this award it creates a certain dilemma, because I had decided if I had the good fortune to win that I would give it to my wife, who deserves it. But this evening I discovered backstage that they're worth fifteen thousand dollars...and now I'm not so sure. Cherie, I'm only kidding, it's yours. But if such a thing as a wish accompanied this award mine would be that we ended the writers' strike. And I thank you all sincerely.

 I would especially like to thank—after having thanked the governors of the Academy and the members, and all the millions of fans I have all over the world, in the civilized parts of the world—I would very much like to thank one specific gentleman without whose help I would not be standing here tonight. I have forgotten his name but I have never forgotten his compassion. He was the American consul in Mexicali, Mexico.

 Now, imagine it's 1934. It's a year after the Hitler putsch. We are all in exile: Zurich, London, Paris. Then I get lucky. I sell a story to Hollywood and I get the visitor's visa for six months. Then I come here and start working, but six months go by very, very fast. Well, I don't want to leave. I would like to stay in America. So, I am being told that I need an immigration visa, for which reason you—I mean, you have to leave the country, get the immigration visa and then come back in order to re-enter with the proper papers. So I go to Mexicali which is the closest American consulate right across the border from California. And as they showed me into the office of the consul I was drenched in sweat. It was not the heat. It was just the panic, the fear. I knew that I needed a whole bunch of documents: affidavits, official proof of former residence, sworn testaments that I had never been a criminal or an anarchist. I had nothing, zilch. Just my passport and my birth certificate and some letters from a few American friends vouching that I was harmless. It looked hopeless.

 The consul—he looked a little bit like Will Rogers—examined my meager documentation. ""Is that all you have?"" he asked. And I said, ""Yes."" I have to explain that, you know, I had to get out of Berlin on very short notice, like twenty minutes. A neighbor had tipped me off that two men in uniform had been looking for me. I had just enough time to throw in a few things in the suitcase and get on a night train to Paris. The consul just stared at me and said, ""I mean, how do you expect me to, with just those papers?"" And I told him, I tried to get them from Nazi Germany but they just would not respond. Of course I could get them if I went back to Germany, then they would put me naturally on the train and ship me off to Dachau. So, he just kept staring and staring at me and I was not sure whether I was getting through to him. I have heard of whole families who have spent years there waiting for the visa and other guys who never got in. And believe me, I wanted to get back to America. It looked bad.

 So we just sat there and stared at each other, the consul and I, in total silence. Finally he asked me, ""What do you do? I mean professionally?"" And I said, ""I write movies."" And he said, ""That so?"" He got up and started pacing, kind of behind me, but I felt that he was measuring me. Then he came back to the desk, picked up my passport, opened it, and took a rubber stamp and went [thumps twice on the podium], handed me back the passport and he said, ""Write some good ones.""

 That was fifty-four years ago. I've tried ever since. I certainly did not want to disappoint that dear man in Mexicali. And you know, as I look back, you know, I've lived a charmed life. I never expected something like this, like the Thalberg Award. You are without any doubt the most generous people in the world. And I hope you're watching, I. A. L., because part of this is yours. So get well, will you? Thank you very, very much.

And I also thank Tom Hanks and Max von Sydow and James Olmos and my good friend Gene Hackman for their wonderful work, even if they didn't vote for me. [Laughs] I didn't vote for you guys, either. It's a pleasure to be here with such good work.

 I thank my agent Mike Ovitz and Tony Thomopoulos for making this project stick with glue when it was falling apart. I thank all the producers. I thank the wonderful cast and the crew of this film who were so emotionally connected with us. I thank the writers, Barry Morrow and Ron Bass. And I just want to thank all the people I talked to that were autistic, and their families, and the doctors and all their help. And our associate producer, Gail Mutrux, got a hold of us, got a hold of for me to meet particularly, Kim Peek, who was the first inspiration of the film, Joe Sullivan and his mother, and my special thanks to Peter and Kevin Guthrie.

 My father so wanted to be here tonight. Ironically, a few weeks ago he joined the family of the disabled. And I understand that the hospital where he's at tonight, that a lot of people that I've met recently are gathered with him with tuxedos and champagne cups and formals. And they're all watching this show right now on a big TV that they rented. So to the...[applause]. It was just a few weeks ago that he was at the Golden Globes and he says, ""Let's find Gene Hackman."" Because he knows we're old roommates. ""C'mon, let's find Gene."" Anyway, to the wonderful doctors and nurses and rehabilitation people, and to the families that I've met recently, and to my father and to his new friends: Here's looking at you. Thank you.

 There's a lot of Brits here tonight. It's scary. But I have to thank a few of them. This is astonishing. A thank you to Michael Shamberg, the producer of ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" who got me together, oh, six or seven years ago with John Cleese, and he said, ""I want to write a movie where you get run over by a steamroller and eat of a lot of Michael Palin's tropical fish."" I said, ""Great, sounds good. I'm in. Let's do it."" And then he actually wrote it.

 I'd like to thank the Academy for naming me in this group of most distinguished actors, the five nominees. I share this with you. I would like to thank John Cleese for writing this brilliant script, for his generosity, for his friendship. To my fellow actors, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis. To Jonathan Benson. To Charlie Crichton, who at seventy-seven proves that even with twenty or twenty-five years off there's no such thing as growing old when you've got a dream. He's the best. Thank you very much for this. And I'd like to thank my wife Phoebe. Thanks.

And I have to thank my wife Diana who, when I walked into the bedroom, when I said, ""I can do 'Rain Man,'"" and she was seven months pregnant. I said, ""What do you want to do?"" And she said, ""Let's go on the road and do the movie and have the baby wherever we're traveling to."" We had a little baby boy and I thank her for that.

My father had the honor of being the first recipient of this award, and received it again on two other occasions. He set a standard of filmmaking which I have strived to uphold. I am very proud of this honor and obviously my thanks go to many people. The artists who have been part of our films. David, my partner and dear friend for many years. My wife and partner, Lili, who has brought so much inspiration into my life. And to my father, who taught me so much and who gave me such an early opportunity. Thank you very much.

 Thank you, Dick, and thank you, Michael. What can I add to this extraordinary evening? ""Thank you"" seems too mild a response to the Academy's governors for this kind of honor. Frankly, I'm simply overwhelmed. Simply, I'm frankly overwhelmed!

 And yet I must add that I am also grateful to both Zanucks, Darryl and Dick. Darryl brought me to Hollywood, and I had the good fortune and longevity to continue the Zanuck connection through the many years Dick and I shared as partners and close friends. We intend to continue to justify the accolade the Academy's Governors have bestowed on us and hope to be worthy of the distinguished company in which they have placed us. Thanks also to you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy, and to my non-voting, beautiful wife.

 Billy Crystal, [laughs] I crap bigger than him. You know, there are times when you reach a certain age plateau where the producers say, they talk about you and they say, ""Well, what do you think? Can we risk it? Can we do it? Can we use him?"" The other guy says, ""I don't know, let's look at some younger ones. We can make them look older, but this one, you know, it's kind of difficult."" They forget, they forget to ask that you go out there and you do all these…things. Like for instance, you know, [leaves podium] you go out there, you do these one-arm push-ups. [Does three one-arm push-ups on stage; returns to podium.] That's nothing, really. As far as the two-handed push-ups are concerned, you can do that all night and it doesn't make any difference whether she's there or not. And besides, it's a hell of a lot less expensive.

 Wow. You know, a long time ago in 1949, first picture, 1949, first film, I'd been shooting about two weeks and the producer came to me and he said, ""Jack"" – my name at that time was Vladimir, but he called me Jack. He says, ""Jack, you're going to win the Academy Award."" Can you believe it? Forty-two years later he was right. How the son of a bitch knew?! Thank you.

And like thousands of actors before me and thousands of actors after me, I went through the usual scores of moonlighting jobs, the usual scores of rejection, and the usual legions of prophets of doom who are always there and always at the ready to give you the up-to-minute odds against your ever making anything of yourself in this business. And at this moment, all of those sort of doleful memories have suddenly transformed themselves into nothing more than the sort of charming and amusing anecdotes for my memoirs!

 In the context of my movie-loving life this is very unanticipated. The only way I can really understand this is to recognize that I had the great good fortune to have a chance to work with Ted Tally's great adaptation of Thomas Harris' extraordinarily moral and amazing book, and to have the good fortune to work with the likes of Tak Fujimoto and Kristi Zea, Craig McKay and Tommy Fleischman and Chris Newman and Howard Shore and Howard Feuer and Billy Miller and, and everybody. And also to be able to work with such an ensemble cast of actors: with Jodie and Tony of course, and also Ted Levine for his exceptionally courageous performance as ""Jame Gumb,"" and Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith and Diane Baker, and all the other wonderful actors.

 I also—this won't take forever, sorry—I also had the extraordinary good fortune to have been embraced by Orion Pictures at a time which, unlike this amazing peak moment of my life, I was at a kind of low-valley moment when Mike Medavoy and Bill Bernstein and Arthur Krim and Eric Pleskow kind of reached out to me and encouraged me and helped create a home for my collaborators and myself. And we made some movies for them. And I'll never forget when Mike Medavoy said, ""I think there's a book you might be interested in. I'll send it over."" And it's obvious, I know everybody feels the extraordinary irony of what's happened, this terrible thing that's happened to Orion at a moment of re-emergence that included ""Silence of the Lambs"" and many other things.

 Anyway, two other quick things. I'm sorry, this is almost—one, just about directing. I wanted very much to salute John Singleton and Matty Rich and Jodie Foster and Ernest Dickerson and a bunch of new people in the last year that have come on with very exciting, wonderful visions and really breathed tremendously important new life into our whole cinematic landscape. And I really want to salute those people very strongly. I also want to very, very quickly—I had the good fortune of being encouraged and briefed by two great American filmmakers who are no longer with us. And I very much, I'm thrilled to be able to invoke the recent memory of two great men, two great filmmakers: Hal Ashby and Martin Ritt, who were really, really wonderful to me.

 And finally, I've obviously got to say, ""Hi, Mom,"" and thanks for transferring your love of movies to me. And thanks, Dad, for making me think I could actually be part of this industry. And thank you. Thank you.

 Thank you to the Academy for recognizing me among such distinguished colleagues. You can't reach for one of these without standing on the shoulders of giants. And my own particular giants are Tom Harris, who so graciously lent me his brilliant novel, and Jonathan Demme, a director of awesome talent and generosity and one of the finest men I've ever known. My heartfelt admiration and gratitude to both of those gentlemen. Thanks also to Jodie Foster, Tony Hopkins, Scott Glenn for their astonishing performances, and to the extraordinary family of artists and craftsmen who so honored my work with their own. Thanks to my producers Ed Saxon, Kenneth Utt, Ron Bozman, Gary Goetzman. To the executives and staff of Orion Pictures, past and present, for their spectacular support.

I want to thank my husband who helped me so much in ways that I could never tell him, and it wasn't by being like ""Darryl."" He wasn't the model for any of the characters. In fact my brother was. I'm just kidding. I really want to thank my mother who taught me everything about love and loyalty that a gal could ever need to know. And all my friends and family, thank you. Thanks.

 Well, it's an extraordinary experience for me to be here tonight to receive this magnificent award; certainly the best achievement of my movie-making career. When I was a small, small school boy, I was terribly interested in the cinema. Became a film fan, wrote to Deanna Durbin. Got a reply, was delighted. Wrote to Ginger Rogers, didn't get a reply. Then of course, I got interested in the cinema as an art form, and I wrote a twelve-page letter to Billy Wilder after seeing ""Double Indemnity."" He didn't reply either. Well, there you are. I have learned everything I've learned about the craft of cinema from the making of American films. I've been watching American films very carefully over the years and I loved them for what they entertain, and then later loved them for what they taught. So, I express my gratitude to the American cinema, to the motion picture association who have given me this award and who have made me feel so proud. Thank you very, very much.

1991,64,1992-03-30,Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,Steven Spielberg (with live segment from space shuttle Atlantis),Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,,NA,NA,George Lucas,"GEORGE LUCAS:
 I'd like to thank the Academy members and the Board of Governors for this tremendous honor, not only for myself, but for the thousands of talented men and women, robots and aliens and others with whom I've been lucky enough to share the creative experience in the last few years. Movies are not made in isolation; it's a group activity. And it's only because of the work, the very hard work, of many actors, writers, directors, producers, creative technicians, thousands of assistants of all kinds, and projectionists, that I'm able to stand here and accept this award. I'm very, very grateful to them all.

 I'd especially like to thank a group of devoted individuals who, apart from my parents, have done the most to shape my life: my teachers. From kindergarten through college their struggle—and it was a struggle—to help me learn to grow and learn was not in vain, and it is greatly appreciated. I've always tried to be aware of what I say in my films because all of us who make motion pictures are teachers, teachers with very loud voices. But we will never match the power of the teacher who is able to whisper in a student's ear. Thank you, Francis, for being my mentor. And finally, thanks to my current and most important teachers, my two daughters. They have taught me more and enriched my life beyond anything imaginable. After twenty years this award comes at what I hope is the halfway point in my career, and I assure you that I will strive to be worthy of all it signifies. Thank you very, very much.

 You broke my streak. The last... I was at an affair recently—thank you so much for this by the way—I was at a ceremonial-type thing like this recently, and I didn't have a speech. I kept going into my pocket for a speech, but I never wrote one. But now I got one. It's here, and I should have had a little water before I got on because my mouth's dry. But I thank you and I just have to say...

 First, I don't know where he is in the house, I can't pick him out, but I got to thank him. I'm completely indebted to Marty Brest who directed the picture and who had such great love for this character I played. And that love is what he communicated to me every day, so I thank you, Marty, for that. I thank Bo Goldman, who wrote such a complicated, interesting, funny guy that could be and would be any actor's dream part. That part was so great. I thank Chris O'Donnell, my co-star in this. He made every day a pleasure for me. And I thank the wonderful support of cast and crew, of course. I also want to thank Tom Pollock and Casey Silver at Universal Pictures, and my agent Rick Nicita who urged me to do this part and actually threatened me if I didn't do it, 'cause I didn't want to do the part for some reason. Ira Lewis, my friend and my colleague, who helped me, Ira Lewis. And The Associated Blind for their generous support to me.

 If you'll indulge me for a minute—I'm just not used to this, so I had to write this down. I had this thought, and I thought if I ever got up here I would say it. I've been very lucky. I found desire for what I do early in my life and I'm lucky because I had people who encouraged that desire, from Lee Strasberg, to my great friend and mentor Charlie Laughton, to the great writers and filmmakers that I've been fortunate enough to work with. Now, recently a young girl came up to me. I was at a function for the South Bronx, which is where I'm from. And she said that I had encouraged her, and that's not necessarily by my work but just by the fact that we came from the same place. And I just can't forget that girl, and I can't forget the kids out there who may be thinking tonight that if he can do it, I can do it. So this is really a proud and hopeful moment for me, because I want to thank the Academy for giving us a gift of encouragement. And this is a gift, a great gift to me. I thank you all, really. Thank you.

Because it's overwhelming to see so many faces who've entertained and influenced me and thrilled me all my life, and it just takes my breath away. And if I could thank you all I would, but I have more pressing debts: to E. M. Forster, for creating ""Margaret Schlegel;"" to James Ivory, for asking me to play her; to Ismail Merchant, for paying me to play her, which feels very unnecessary at this moment. Actually, I think I might have to give back the money. And to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, for her flawless adaptation. To a superlative cast and crew. To Sony Pictures Classics, for their dedication and commitment. And especially to Sir Anthony Hopkins, for being, like this, the (k)night of my life. And finally I would like, if I may, to dedicate this Oscar to the heroism and the courage of women, and to hope that it inspires the creation of more true screen heroines to represent them.

Because for me it was a very special film, as I was welcomed into the family of Ismail Merchant and Jim Ivory. And I would very much like to pay a great tribute to them, because in Ismail we found a constructive and enthusiastic and encouraging producer, and in Jim a charismatic and meticulous director who believes in the visual importance of the film and who brooks no compromise. And I'm very deeply honored to have this award in this year of honoring women in movies, [music begins to play] especially in my capacity. Was that the end?

That's an opportunity I think a lot of people don't have.

 I've got to thank the crew, David Valdes, and Jack Green, and all the camera crew -- the trouble is with living this long is you know so many people and you can't remember their names. You get a little flustered. But in the year of the woman I'd like to salute the women of Big Whiskey. That would be Anna Thomson, and Frances Fisher, and Liisa, and Tara, and Josie, and Beverley, and all the gals who really were the catalyst to getting this story off the ground. And David Peoples' fabulous script. Warner Bros., for sticking with this film. The film critics, for discovering this film. It wasn't a highly tout[ed] film when it came out but they sort of stayed with it throughout the year. The French film critics who embraced some of my work very early in the game, the British Film Institute, the Museum of Modern Art are some of the people that were there long before I ever became fashionable. Lenny Hirshan, my agent,...I'm leaving out a whole mess of people I'm gonna regret when I sit down again. Anyway, thank you very much.

 Thank you.

 BARBARA TRENT:
 As well as the other two producers without whose perseverance the film would never have been completed, Nico Panigutti and Joanne Doroshow. We'd like to take a moment and dedicate this film to all the people who have worked so hard for justice and truth and peace around the world. And particularly the four people who have died who were working in association with this film, and the hundreds and possibly thousands of Panamanians who died in this invasion, whose stories might never otherwise be told because of the deceptive practices and tactics of our government with the complicity—I don't like it either, but it's the way it is—with the complicity of the major media.

 We would like to also dedicate the film to the courageous Panamanian journalists and human rights activists who have defied the Panamanian ban against the screening of this film, at personal risk, to show it in the last few weeks in Panama, which, by the way, reversed the censorship ban which was nationwide. And to the millions of Americans who may or may not get to see this film now that public TV has also refused a broadcast.

 In closing, I'd just like to say we have a tremendous amount of potential in the world and those of us here have a tremendous amount of potential to impact the world. Let's use it. Let's challenge this new administration to reverse the legacy that we have left through our policies in the world and become the Americans that we're capable of. Thank you very, very much.

It is the highest possible accolade I could receive from my peers, and for doing something I just have to do, that my passion must do. I am filled with pride and humility.

 I accept this award in honor of all the men, women and children with AIDS who are waging incredibly valiant battles for their lives, those to whom I have given my commitment, the real heroes of the pandemic of AIDS. I am so proud of the work that people in Hollywood have done to help so many others, like dearest, gentle Audrey [Hepburn].

 Tonight I am asking for your help. I call upon you to draw from the depths of your being to prove that we are a human race. To prove that our love outweighs our need to hate. That our compassion is more compelling than our need to blame. That our sensitivity to those in need is stronger than our greed. That our ability to reason overcomes our fear. And that at the end of each of our lives, we can look back and be proud that we have treated others with the kindness, dignity and respect that every human being deserves. Thank you and God bless.

I know also that, I should not be doing this, I should not be here, but I am because of the union of such filmmakers as Ed Saxon, Ron Nyswaner, Kristi Zea, Tak Fujimoto, Jonathan Demme -- who seems to have these [referring to the Oscar] attached to his limbs for every actor that works with him of late. And a cast that includes Antonio Banderas, who, second to my lover, is the only person I would trade for. And a cast that includes many other people, but the actor who really put his film image at risk, and shone because of his integrity, Mr. Denzel Washington, who I really must share this with.

 I would not be standing here if it weren't for two very important men in my life, so... two that I haven't spoken with in awhile, but I had the pleasure of just the other evening. Mr. Rawley Farnsworth, who was my high school drama teacher, who taught me to act well the part, there all the glory lies. And one of my classmates under Mr. Farnsworth, Mr. John Gilkerson. I mention their names because they are two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with, to fall under their inspiration at such a young age. I wish my babies could have the same sort of teacher, the same sort of friends.

 And there lies my dilemma here tonight. I know that my work in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names. They number a thousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight. They finally rest in the warm embrace of the gracious creator of us all. A healing embrace that cools their fevers, that clears their skin, and allows their eyes to see the simple, self-evident, common sense truth that is made manifest by the benevolent creator of us all and was written down on paper by wise men, tolerant men, in the city of Philadelphia two hundred years ago. God bless you all. God have mercy on us all. And God bless America.

 I'm so overwhelmed. To be with that group of actresses just slays me. When I was six years old I started pretending to play the piano on the window sills of my bedroom in the house where I grew up. And then after a while my parents realized that I wasn't going to stop, so they got me a cardboard keyboard to play to see if that might, you know, if I would get tired of that. But I wasn't. I didn't. And so then they got me a piano. So for the next ten years they let me have piano lessons. So I need to thank Eileen Parish, my first piano teacher, and I need to thank my parents for letting me have these lessons.

 And Jane Campion, I love you, I love you. Thank you so much for giving me a character and an experience that was so difficult to say good-bye to, except that I don't have to say good-bye to it because it's everybody's now. And that is such a gift. And Michael Nyman, who really gave me a veritable instruction manual for a way into ""Ada McGrath"" by giving the music, giving me the music that he gave me and the entire movie to experience. And Jan Chapman, our producer, for being so luminous and for giving ""The Piano"" and all of us a place to flourish. Harvey and Bob Weinstein, you also break my heart with your uncensored passion and support for this movie. And just thank you all so much for letting this movie in. And thanks.

He's the man who talked Thomas Keneally into writing the book. I owe him such a debt. All of us owe him such a debt. He has carried the story of Oskar Schindler to all of us. A man of complete obscurity who makes us wish and hope for Oskar Schindlers in all of our lives.

I need to thank some great crew members, a wonderful team, great cinematographers Don Lenzer and Eddie Marritz, composer Charles Bernstein, William T.

And I have to thank them all for making this and ""Gump"" happen. Especially Bob Zemeckis, who stretches himself and the medium of film every time he goes out and makes a film. And in so doing he stretches all of us who have the challenge and the fun and the excitement and the pleasure of working with his amazing talent. Thank you, Bob. And thank you all very much.

 I'd like to say thank you to the Academy for this honor. And it's just so wonderful to be acknowledged with a great group of movies. Nine years ago I met a very special man who has since taken me on an amazing journey. There were many people who gave him gifts along the way. Eric Roth, you gave ""Forrest"" a soul. Tom Hanks, you gave ""Forrest"" a heart. And Bob Zemeckis, you gave ""Forrest"" a vision. Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, you were great co-parents. ""Forrest"" was a labor of love to many people: our wonderful cast and crew, Sherry, Jon, Michelle, John, Barry, Arthur, all the people at Paramount, Winston, Craig, Rand. To my parents, grandparents, family, thank you for your support. To my husband Mark Canton, for your love and always saying go make this dream a reality. My parents always said dreams can come true, and to my own children, Dorothy, Henry and James, if you doubt it, please remember tonight because I always will. Thank you.

 STEVE TISCH:
 All over the political map people have been calling ""Forrest"" their own. But ""Forrest Gump"" isn't about politics or conservative values. It's about humanity. It's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love. And tonight we should all feel proud that we are in a business where we entertain, we educate, and we empower. I'd like to thank my family, my parents Joan and Bob, love to Jamie and to my two wonderful children, Hilary and Willy, and to my four best friends. And finally, thanks to all the ""Forrest Gumps"" in the world.

 STEVE STARKEY:
 Well, I truly want to thank the Academy for making me the final person to thank them tonight. Now I don't know if it was destiny or if it was chance that brought together the talented cast and extraordinary crew of ""Forrest Gump,"" but maybe as ""Forrest"" said: ""Maybe it was both, maybe both were happening at the same time."" But in any case, as I look back I can't imagine making this film without any one of them or without the commitment of Sherry Lansing and Paramount Studios. But most of all, the picture could not have been made without the gentle spirit of Tom Hanks and the guidance and inspiration of the guy we fondly call Bob Z, the truly visionary director Bob Zemeckis. And I wish to thank them all, and especially my wife Olivia who has stood beside me over the years in everything I've done. And hello to my parents. Thank you all very much.

 Thank you. It's nice to feel important. I think maybe a bit more important to be nice, though. This moment, this evening, this spot where I stand tonight was not my destination when I was young and full of vinegar. I did not engineer this journey. To tell you the truth, I don't think I could even see this far. And now that I'm older and full of wonder, I can see that maybe other forces were at the wheel.

 You may have seen my mother Sarah in my music and witnessed the laughter and tears of my children, of my family. They were the pillars beneath this life of mine; theirs is the humanity reflected in this moment. You may be familiar with the countless shoulders that I stood upon to just see where I might go. They were the pillars that were beneath my life; theirs is the humanity reflected in this moment. I also hope you can see reflections of the gift of friendship so generously given to me by Benny Carter, Sidney Poitier, Mo Ostin—happy birthday, Mo—Clarence Avant, and Steve Ross, my gurus of givingness, and the multitude of others who too have been pillars beneath this life of mine. I accept this great honor in their names on this, the proudest day of my life. Thank you, governors of the Academy, for including me in such prestigious company.

 And you Americans out there, please join the rising support for the National Endowment for the Arts. Each act of creation can be another powerful pillar beneath this life of this wonderful and troubled nation of ours.

 I'd like to thank the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for this wonderful award. You know, I look back through, over the years of the recipients of this since 1937, and I see Darryl Zanuck and the great Hal Wallis, and William Wyler, and Billy Wilder, and Alfred Hitchcock, and Stevens, all these people that I grew up idolizing. They were my boyhood idols as far as filmmakers. And a lot of them were directors, producers -- and just straight producers -- and they were experts. These people had a great influence and they were experts in a business that has very few experts, really. In fact, if anybody asked me about making films I would say that it's probably a little expertise and a lot of luck. Now, how I fit into that equation? Well, if ""Dirty Harry,"" if I was in his sights and he said, ""Do you feel lucky?"" I'd say, ""You're damn right I do."" Thank you. Thank my family. Thank everyone.

On their behalf I wish to thank you for honoring their memory, and you cannot do it in any better way than when you return to your homes tonight to realize that each of you who know the joy of freedom are winners. Thank you on their behalf with all my heart.

And although my name alone is on this award, I want to share it with everyone at Pixar Animation Studios, the incredible little studio that made ""Toy Story,"" and to the Walt Disney Studios for believing that we could do it. ""Toy Story"" was a labor of love that took over four years to complete.

 Well, what can I say in the face of such humiliating evidence? I stand guilty before the world of directing over three hundred cartoons in the last fifty or sixty years. Hopefully this means you've forgiven me. When, in 1931, I came stumbling out of Chouinard Art Institute into the arid maelstrom of the Great Depression in the wan hope that I could resume my school career as a janitor, a miracle occurred so staggeringly unexpected and unbelievable that I find it incredible even today. Somebody offered to pay me to draw. And so this miracle continues. For nearly seventy years I've been paid adequately, if not lavishly, for doing what I enjoy doing most. A miracle indeed. Robert Frost expresses it best: ""My object in life,"" he said, ""is to unite my avocation and my vocation, as my two eyes are one in sight."" My deepest thanks for this signal and shining award, and my love to Marian and Linda and to the laughing denizens of Termite Terrace, wherever you are. Thank you.

 I said my cup was full before, now it runneth over. I'd like to thank actors. I love actors. Producers are supposed to not be in love with them, but I love 'em. And I love writers and directors, too. Uh, and everyone who worked on, the whole crew, everyone who worked on the picture for what they did in making the picture happen. When we were shut down, ran out of money, everyone stayed there. In Italy, without pay. And we had no money to pay 'em. And then Harvey and Bob Weinstein came through and financed the picture -- and we had final cut, though. And all, everyone just who was involved, with all the people at Miramax who were wonderful in working on the picture. But before, I wanna tell one Shakespeare story that I wish I could remember the writer, but I can't. Uh, Shakespeare, the definition... Shakespeare was defined as an early plagiarizer of Freud. Okay, I like it.

 ANTHONY MINGHELLA:
 [To Zaentz:] Thank Michael Ondaatje.

 SAUL ZAENTZ:
 I want to thank -- no, two others, not to thank but to say one of the best things that's happened to Michael Ondaatje, Anthony and myself, we each made two friends. And Michael's stunning novel just inspired Anthony and then inspired me, and I can't say too much about Michael. And to Annette, thank you. To the boys on the corner, Myrtle and Monroe*, and the gang up in Berkeley, thank you all.

 Thank you, Jools. Jools, you're a treasure for being here. Thank you.

 I didn't know how to handle all this, but my wife Shelah, who was my assistant on many of these pictures and naturally bore the brunt of my grouchiness, said to me: Michael, the Academy is honoring you. For once stop being Mr. Bah Humbug and try to enjoy it, at least for your family and friends' sake. Well, she's not only beautiful, she's right. So, Shelah, and Matthew, Amy, Kris, and Susan -- and even Julie [Andrews] who calls me an old curmudgeon -- and the many friends who wrote or phoned with the same message, once the reality of all this sinks in I promise to enjoy it. I've even had my glasses tinted slightly rose-colored.

 So many of today's films stress the terrors that await us. Perhaps this award signifies an awareness that we have been missing something, namely the vitality and the joy of living that movie musicals can express in song and dance. I thank the Academy for this tribute. I accept it in the name of all choreographers and especially the dancers who made it all possible. We feel honored. Thank you.

 Thank you, Michael. Twenty-five years ago we worked together and he hasn't forgiven me since for yelling at him. But, that's show business.

 I'd like to talk to [you] for a minute about passion. Don't move around in your chairs, or change the station on your TV set, as the following words will be innocent. Darryl Zanuck, Hal Wallis, David Selznick, Walt Disney and Samuel Goldwyn are among the giants who were the early recipients of this award. All are recognized as producers who brought passion to their films. And they were really bound together by their love of moviemaking. Passion is [the] immeasurable, indescribable factor that separates movie from movie. Passion moves freely across borders, speaks every language and flourishes in every culture. The movement of passion is the most gratifying satisfaction in any moviemaker's life. This happens when you see and hear people all over the world share their laughter, their crying and their sudden gasps at identical screen moments. Samuel Hoffenstein, a poet and screenwriter, poetically wrote, ""The Holy Grail is not in the finding, it is in the journey."" The Irving Thalberg Award memorializes a giant among giants who brought us a sense of film history. This belongs to the many with whom I have shared dreams and journeys. My cup is full. Thank you.

But I have a lot of people that I have to thank on behalf of both Jim and myself. I want to thank all the nominees here this evening, and all the people that again they've already thanked. Our incredible cast, we would not be here without you. My wife Julie, my sons Jamie and Jody. Rae Sanchini, who is absolutely one of the best people in this industry. My mom and dad, Edie and Ely.

 I think Jon saw ""Shine"" too many times. He thanked everybody and did everything I was going to say. And my eyes are still sort of doing pinwheels from the last one, so I just want to say a couple of things. We're here tonight to celebrate the magic of movies. And I'm grateful every day to get to be a part of that magic and a practitioner in it, and I love it. And tonight has been such a great celebration for us. And it seems to somehow express this strange wave that's happened with ""Titanic,"" where people all over the world have opened their hearts to this movie. And that's so gratifying to all of us that worked on it and we'll be forever grateful to them, the audience, and I know a lot of you are watching at home.

 In the midst of all this euphoria, it's kind of hard for us to remember that this euphoria and the success is for a film that's based on a real event that happened, where real people died, that shocked the world in 1912. So I'd just like everybody to go with me just for a second on something here. I'd like to do a few seconds of silence in remembrance of the 1,500 men, women and children who died when the great ship died. The message of ""Titanic"" of course is, that if the great ship can sink, the unthinkable can happen, the future is unknowable, the only thing that we truly own is today. Life is precious. So during these few seconds I'd like you to also listen to the beating of your own heart which is the most precious thing in the world. Join me please in a few seconds of silence for ""Titanic"" . . . . Thank you very much. That's about as much as I'm sure Gil Cates can stand. All right, you've really made this a night to remember in every way. Now let's go party till dawn.

 I'm going to let you in on the secret of being a good director. For the script you get Larry Gelbart, or Peter Stone, or Huyck and Katz, or Frederic Raphael -- like that. If it's a musical, for the songs you get George and Ira Gershwin, or Arthur Freed and Herb Brown, or Leonard Bernstein and Comden and Green, or Alan Lerner and Fritz Loewe -- like that. Then you cast Cary Grant, or Audrey Hepburn, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Sophia Loren, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor, Burt Reynolds, Gene Hackman or Frank Sinatra -- like that. When filming starts you show up and you stay the hell out of the way. But you've got to show up, you've got to show up. Otherwise you can't take the credit and get one of these fellas.

 Well, speaking of leaks. We get few enough chances in our lives to put pleasure into the world. I feel very happy and lucky to be -- having been connected with ""Shakespeare in Love."" I'd like to thank on behalf of Tom, everybody at Miramax who worked so hard, especially Harvey Weinstein, a man of dedication and vision. A cast and crew that was exceptional. They are doing pretty well tonight as you've seen. My personal thanks to my family: my wife Dale, my sons Alex and Zach. All my parents, all my parents-in-law, who I will be with shortly when all this wonderful hoo-ha is over. Thank you.

My thanks to the Academy, to Marc, to Donna Gigliotti and David Parfitt who played good cop and very sweet cop to Commissioner Harvey. To John Madden, who is available. And since Gwyneth mentioned her agent I thought I'd mention mine. He's older and nicer. Ken Ewing is my guest tonight. I sent him my first play thirty-eight years ago and we're still here. Thank you.

 Not bad for a goy. What do you say, Irving? They really keep this show going. Forty years of filmmaking and they did it in three minutes! Well, Irving, you're one heavy dude. I'll tell you that... You want to hold him? He's about twenty pounds!

 There's a lot of people to thank, of course, but Irving once said that brevity is a great virtue. So, I accept this great honor tonight in the names of all those people who have contributed to my work, my life's work. Forty years ago, I sat at William Wyler's feet and tried to learn how to make movies. And Willy Wyler was a god to me, and he won this award. And I think that's what is so meaningful to me, to join all those filmmakers that have gone before. I would like to thank my immediate loved ones, my family, every actor, writer, editor, cinematographer, production designer, costume designer, sound man and editor I've ever worked with. All those crews in Europe and Canada and the United States.

 And my one real regret about winning this prize is that, you know, it's not like the Nobel or the Pulitzer. I mean, the Thalberg Award comes with no money attached. If it did, if it did, I would share it with the Canadian Film Centre and the AFI where the next generation of filmmakers are preparing to entertain the world in the new millennium. And my parting thought to all those young filmmakers is this: Just find some good stories. Never mind the gross, the top ten, bottom ten, what's the rating, what's the demographic. You know something, the biggest grossing picture is not necessarily the best picture, I want to tell you something. So just tell stories that move us to laughter and tears, and perhaps reveal a little truth about ourselves. And as for myself, I hope to see you again next year!

 This is the highlight of my day. I hope it is not all downhill from here. I first have to say that I would like to dedicate this to the man who inspired my performance. A man who has been my friend and my mentor, and since my father died, a little bit like my father, whose performance in ""The Apartment"" stands as one of the finest we've ever had. Jack Lemmon, wherever you are, thank you, thank you, thank you.

 To my friends, for pointing out my worst qualities. I know you do it because you love me. And that's why I loved playing ""Lester,"" because we got to see all of his worst qualities and we still grew to love him. This movie to me is all about how any single act from any single person put out of context is damnable. But the joy of this movie is that it is real beauty. We found real beauty in this extraordinary script by Sam Mendes -- by Alan Ball. It feels like he wrote it though, doesn't it?

 I am very proud to be an actor, and I have tried very hard to protect my work; and I am stunned and a bit speechless. And Dianne, thank you for teaching me about caring about the right things, and I love you. And Mother, I don't care what they say about bringing you to award shows. I will always bring you to award shows because I'm proud of you and I love you. And thank you, thank you, thank you.

 Thank you, thank you. I was looking [gesturing to the monitor], watching all the others, and thinking back when I saw the performances and I was thinking of how the Academy changed ""The winner is..."" to ""The Oscar goes to..."". And if ever there was a category where the Oscar goes to someone without there being a winner, it's this one. Because I do not feel like being the winner. You have Michael, who I'd never heard of quite frankly, who is astonishing. You have Jude, who is going to be a big star no matter what happens. You have Tom, who if you had won this your pot price would have gone down so fast. Have you any idea what supporting actors get paid? And we only get one motorhome, a small one. And Haley Osment, what an astonishing... where is he? There he is. Haley, when I saw you I thought, well that's me out of it. So really, I'm basically up here, guys, to represent you as what I hope you will all be, a survivor.

 I want to -- I've got to hurry up or they... Dick [Zanuck], I wasn't here last time, so give me a bit with my speech, the last time I won, so give me a bit extra time, okay? I want to thank Harvey and Bob Weinstein and Meryl Poster at Miramax. Lasse Hallström, an extraordinary director, and Richard Gladstein. The wonderful actors I worked with: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker -- all people who inhabit rather than act. And the wonderful children that I acted with there.

It's quite remarkable. I want to thank the Academy for their support and recognition of me and my work in a movie that is so important, and I am so proud to be a part of it.

 This movie would have never been made -- I had, just on the off chance that I got up here, I brought this piece of paper because I knew I couldn't forget anyone, because everyone put their heart and soul into this movie and God knows no one got paid. So first, Kimberly Peirce, for her fierce tenacity and vision. Andy Bienen, our co-writer. Killer Films, you guys always make important movies and I thank you for that. John Hart, Jeff Sharp, for being there for me every single minute. Jim Denault, our cinematographer, who was absolutely brilliant. Kerry Barden, Jennifer McNamara, for fighting for me, the casting directors. Chloë Sevigny, the rest of the cast, who portrayed their characters so honestly and brilliantly. Lee Percy, our editor.

 I want to thank Michael Stremel, Lindsay Law and Bill Mechanic and everyone at Fox Searchlight for putting their wing around this small, little movie and giving us wings. Larry Moss, my acting coach, who, without him, I could have never given this performance. Thank you, Larry. My mom, who's up there somewhere [in the balcony]. It looks like living out of our car was worth it. Holly Hein, for keeping my head on straight. My publicist Troy Nankin, who is a beautiful, beautiful human being. Kami Putnam, I have to thank you for fighting for me. I'm almost done, I promise. The Independent Film Channel, for helping us finish our movie. And Hylda Queally and David Wirtschafter, for their support.

 And last, but certainly not least, I want to thank Brandon Teena for being such an inspiration to us all. His legacy lives on through our movie to remind us to always be ourselves, to follow our hearts, to not conform. I pray for the day when we not only accept our differences, but we actually celebrate our diversity. Thank you very much.

I also share it with two gifted art directors, Les Tomkins and John Dexter, and three wonderful art departments in London, L.A. and New York. I'm grateful for the support and the prodding of producer Scott Rudin, Adam Schroeder and Larry Franco and the backing of Paramount Pictures' Sherry Lansing and Michelle Manning and Nan Morales.

 I can't tell you what a great experience it has been working with this team from DreamWorks. The producers, Dan, and you've seen your moments, Bruce. From a script that I didn't know how we were going to get a movie that anybody liked because they were such unusual characters, until Sam pointed out to me, don't you ever have any unusual thoughts yourself, Conrad, about sixteen-year-old girls that accompany your daughter home? And I thought, oh well... So, I guess we're all part of a wonderful, wonderful, dysfunctional family called the human race, and the ""Fittses"" and the ""Burnhams"" and everybody else partakes of it. But my best family is here tonight. They're my children, my grandchildren, and whose love has supported me all these years.

 I know I am going to forget something and I don't know what it is. The team that I had working with me, Aaron Pazanti, Clyde Bryan and Suzanne Trucks and my son Conrad -- Conrad W. -- who shot some additional scenes for us, and David Golia. What a great time it was working. Sam, you're the best. When you showed up looking exactly like Orson Welles I thought to myself, oh my God. And now I know he's like Orson Welles. Anyway, thank you to the Academy. It's a big honor.

Thank you for giving so much of yourselves to this picture, particularly Kevin and Annette and Chris Cooper and the three younger actors—thank you, Wes, and Thora, Mena.

Consequently the film ""One Day in September"" hasn't been released anywhere in the world. And as a result, with this Oscar, you members of the Academy have given a terrific sign to members of all the world, if the filmmakers, that the Academy in its judgment is not basing itself at all and is not influenced by box office success but it is harping(?) and insisting only on the outstanding quality of a film which can be remembered for a long time.

From Peter Gelb from Sony Classics who introduced me to François Girard, the wonderful director of this film, and Niv Fichman the producer.

Wes, Thora, Mena, Chris, Allison, Peter, Sam and Scott, you brought these characters to life with depths and shadings I never even thought of. Everybody at DreamWorks, for taking a chance on a bunch of first timers, for letting us make the movie and for marketing it so brilliantly. My agent Andrew Cannava. My family, especially my mom. All the writers I have ever worked with, for everything that they taught me. And finally, that plastic bag in front of the World Trade Center so many years ago, for being whatever it is that inspires us to do what we do. Thank you.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I will speak in Polish because I want to say what I think and feel, and I have always thought and felt in Polish. I accept this great honor not as a personal tribute, but as a tribute to all of Polish cinema. The subject of many of our films was the war, the atrocities of Nazism and the tragedies brought by communism. This is why today I thank the American friends of Poland and my compatriots for helping my country rejoin the family of democratic nations, rejoin the Western civilizations, its institutions and security structures. My fervent hope is that the only flames people will encounter will be the great passions of the heart -- love, gratitude and solidarity.

1999,72,2000-03-26,Shrine Auditorium & Expo Center,Jack Nicholson,Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,,NA,NA,Warren Beatty,"WARREN BEATTY:
 Thank you. You know, although some might say it's a little soon to be giving this thing to a guy in his early forties... To have known that I was going to get it, particularly this year with all the... It's been very helpful around the house. I must say that if you had your choice and you could get the Thalberg Award or the White House, I think I'd stick with this. I don't want to talk politics here and I don't want to suggest some direction that the movies should go into, but I think I would like to, if I may, pay tribute to the memory of my mother Kathlyn, my father Ira, and to the people who nurtured me as a child in Virginia with my sister Shirley, and beginning with Stella Adler and Elia Kazan, and to all the people who worked with me and taught me.

 I came to Hollywood when I was in my early twenties. Many of the previous winners of this award actually taught me. You know, Sam Goldwyn was in his eighties, God bless him, and he treated me like a grown-up. Now it's very interesting, I think that most of the people who are teaching me now, they all seem to be in their early twenties and I do whatever I can to keep them -- I try to get them to stop treating me like a grown-up. But I thank them, I thank them.

 I thank my profession for giving me freedom and access. The freedom to live a much fuller life apart from the movies, and the access to get out and get to know the world and then come back and go back to making movies. Please forgive me for not making more of them. I'll try to do better. Thank you so much for encouraging my voice in public affairs. Please forgive me if I've used it stridently, or in fact not often enough. I'll try to do better. To my fellow actors, I would like to say thank you. Thank you for making me look good. I'm first, last, and always an actor, my pride in that is unbounded. Please forgive me for being a producer. I'll try to do better.

 [To Jack Nicholson on stage:] You can't hear me? Let me tell you this... alright.

 Okay, now, to those of you who may have heard rumor here or there of my life in Hollywood as a single man. The poet wrote, ""Only solitary men know the true joy of friendship. Others have their family, but to a solitary man his friends are everything."" So I want to thank you, my friends, for leading me through those days, and finally, in fact, leading me to Annette. Please forgive me for making her unavailable to your movies four times -- that's four times. I would like to say I'll try to do better, but you and I know that I won't. So, let's just say that I'll try to do less. Yes, I'll try to do less. She is my treasure. She has given me what I value most, her love. And she's given me Kathlyn and Ben and Isabel and at the moment, this much anticipated and very loved unnamed being, who could actually join us any minute right here in the second row if I don't wrap this up.

 So, I cannot imagine a public circumstance in which so many affirmations of work and life that could converge at one time. Let me put it another way -- as a screenwriter, I'd never sit still for it. You know, you can't have the husband up here getting this thing and the wife down there maybe getting that thing, and she's having a baby at the same time. It doesn't work, you have to throw it out, you have to pick one, they'll never believe it. So, I would say to you, don't worry, I don't ever expect another evening like this to be so full. But there are some things that really aren't going to change. They don't have to change, and please listen to me on this, Kathlyn and Ben and Isabel, I know you're not in bed. The things that don't have to change for us are our reliability of friendship, the sanctity of our family, and the dignity of our work. Thank you very much from way down here.

 Whew! My grandfather's name was Stan Wemyss. He was a cinematographer in the second World War. My uncle David, David William Crowe, he died last year at the age of sixty-six. I'd like to thank the Academy for something which is pretty surprising and dedicate it to two men who still continue to inspire me. I'd also like to thank my mum and dad, who I just don't thank enough, I suppose.

 And an incredible cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Moeller, Spencer Treat Clark, the magnificent Richard Harris, the late Oliver Reed, Tomas Arana, Tommy Flanagan, Derek Jacobi and everybody else. DreamWorks, a great company and a vital and andrenalized contributor to the art form. To Doug Wick, David Franzoni, Bruno Lustig and Terry Needham, and a very brave crew collected from twenty-two different countries around the world. To the people that work for me, who work with me, my personal cavalry: George Freeman, Alan Hergott, Larry Witzer, Shirley Pearce, Robin Baum, Mark Dumbrell. But really folks, you know, I owe this to one bloke and his name is Ridley Scott. You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland, or Newcastle like Ridley or Jamie Bell, or the suburbs of anywhere, you know, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable. But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imagining[s]. And for anybody who's on the down side of advantage and relying purely on courage, it's possible. Thanks very much.

Greg Jacobs, everybody on our crew that was so great. And, well, just a few other people... But really, the main person -- well, Richard LaGravenese and Susannah Grant who wrote such a nice script.

 Steven Soderbergh -- hi, there you are -- you truly just made me want to be the best actor that I suppose I never knew I could be, or aspire to. And I made every attempt -- Stick-man, I see you. So I thank you for really making me feel so... [laughs!] I love it up here! Yeah, anyway, I start working for him again in two days, so I can get to you later.

I accept this rarest of honors on behalf of all screenwriters everywhere, but especially those in the Writers Guild of America. We have suffered anonymity far too often. I appeal to all movie critics and feature writers to please always bear in mind that a film production begins and ends with a screenplay. However, this glorious night is demonstrating that film belongs to many: to the creators of original works, to superbly talented actors, directors, producers, and to gifted collaborators. Had it not been for all of them, I certainly would not be up here having one of the most exciting nights in a long lifetime.

 I dedicate this Oscar to my dear, departed wife Jacqueline, to my sons Roger and Alan, my daughter-in-law Julie, and to my sweet, darling wife Laurie, who has given me a whole new happy life. And now, on with this great show.

 I must say I've been very lucky in my life. Three continents, different culture[s], through good times and not-so-good times, but today wonderful times, had the privilege to work with the greatest masters of film. Let me dedicate this happy hour to the Italian film industry with the hope they come back in life with new talent and fresh ideas.

 In my life I am proud especial[ly] about one thing, to give the opportunity to so many young director[s] for the first time. And this I want to say something to the big studio[s]: Don't be afraid about young talent. New mind[s], young mind[s] are the future of tomorrow['s] films. And remember, Irving Thalberg himself was only twenty-three years old when he run MGM.

 Finally, let me share this award with all people, talented people, all the young working on my films behind the camera. Thanks to them and to everybody who buy tickets -- especially for my movie[s]. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

 I want to thank the Academy. You know, when I was in college first starting out as an actor, they asked each one of us what we wanted to do. I said I want to be the best actor in the world. All the students in the classroom looked at me like I was a nut. Life has taught me to just try and be the best that I can be, and I thank the Academy for saying to me that on this given night I was the best that I could be. I want to thank Warner Bros. and Alan Horn and Lorenzo di Bonaventura for supporting this film. And Antoine Fuqua, a brilliant young filmmaker, African-American filmmaker.

 It's pretty simple, really. I'm grateful. I'm very grateful for this. I'm grateful for an entire lifetime spent involved in this creative process that we do. I'm grateful that I was raised by an extraordinary man, my father Rance Howard, and my late mother Jean Howard. I also want to mention that before my mom passed away about eighteen months ago, she predicted that this was going to happen for me on this film. Well, she also made that prediction on every movie that I've directed since 1983. So now you know a little something about my mom. Thank you, Mom. Then there are the loves of my life. My incredible wife Cheryl. Yeah, she's something. Kids at home, Bryce, Jocelyn, Paige and Reed. Thank you for all the most important reasons.

 I've got a great friend and a partner, Brian Grazer. Brian, thanks for helping me realize so many of my dreams in this business, including getting to direct ""A Beautiful Mind,"" which Brian produced so passionately and Akiva Goldsman wrote so brilliantly. You know, everyone from the decision makers at Universal and DreamWorks through to the entire production team, thank you for the incredible effort. It made the difference.

 And of course I had a tremendous cast. This is an acting movie. And including Jennifer Connelly. And Russell. Russell Crowe. This would not be happening tonight without your creative courage and your total commitment. It has been a great journey. And I thank you.

And he said in 1963, the year I was born, ""I have a dream that my four children will one day live in one nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" Thirty-eight years later we film, with Denis Poncet, a story about a teenager who had been stopped, arrested and sent to jail because he was just a black kid walking in the street near a crime scene. And if we are doing documentaries, that [is] because we do believe that as storyteller[s] we can help dreams come true.

 DENIS PONCET:
 Just one thing because I know that time is up. This film was supposed to stay in Europe and thanks to somebody called Christine Le Goff it came to the United States. It is thanks to wonderful people at HBO like Sheila Nevins and Nancy Abraham [that] this was possible for you to see, I hope, one day and very close, soon on HBO. Thank you very, very much.

So thank you very much and God bless America.

2001,74,2002-03-24,Kodak Theatre,"Ali MacGraw, Ryan O'Neal",Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Arthur Hiller,"ARTHUR HILLER:
 Thank you, Mama. Thank you, Papa. It feels humbling to receive a humanitarian award for doing what my parents brought me up to do. I had an unbelievably caring mother and father who lived their lives with the moral values of love and compassion, of respect and responsibility, of human dignity and standing up for what's right. Even though they had a hard time earning a living they helped the poor and the hungry and they also helped others who needed the support of a friend or someone to stand up for their rights. They felt all other people as individual human beings and judged them by their actions, not by their color or their race or their religion.

 I wish I could say that I'm as strong as they were in all those areas, but I'm so grateful to them for instilling these values in my loving sisters and me. And I'm so grateful to my loving wife and our wonderful children. My wife's so supportive. And Henryk and Erica just can't be better. Gwen and the kids are always behind me and sometimes pushing me to live up to those values. It's so embarrassing to receive an award for doing what you should be doing, but I must admit it pleases me greatly. And it especially honors me to receive it from this Academy that I respect so deeply and that has always meant so much to me personally. Thank you.

2001,74,2002-03-24,Kodak Theatre,"Denzel Washington, Walter Mirisch",Honorary Award,in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.,NA,NA,Sidney Poitier,"SIDNEY POITIER:
 I arrived in Hollywood at the age of twenty-two in a time different than today's, a time in which the odds against my standing here tonight fifty-three years later would not have fallen in my favor. Back then, no route had been established for where I was hoping to go, no pathway left in evidence for me to trace, no custom for me to follow.

 Yet, here I am this evening at the end of a journey that in 1949 would have been considered almost impossible and in fact might never have been set in motion were there not an untold number of courageous, unselfish choices made by a handful of visionary American filmmakers, directors, writers and producers; each with a strong sense of citizenship responsibility to the times in which they lived; each unafraid to permit their art to reflect their views and values, ethical and moral, and moreover, acknowledge them as their own. They knew the odds that stood against them and their efforts were overwhelming and likely could have proven too high to overcome. Still those filmmakers persevered, speaking through their art to the best in all of us. And I've benefited from their effort. The industry benefited from their effort. America benefited from their effort. And in ways large and small the world has also benefited from their effort.

 Therefore, with respect, I share this great honor with the late Joe Mankiewicz, the late Richard Brooks, the late Ralph Nelson, the late Darryl Zanuck, the late Stanley Kramer, the Mirisch brothers, especially Walter whose friendship lies at the very heart of this moment, Guy Green, Norman Jewison, and all others who have had a hand in altering the odds for me and for others. Without them this most memorable moment would not have come to pass and the many excellent young actors who have followed in admirable fashion might not have come as they have to enrich the tradition of American filmmaking as they have. I accept this award in memory of all the African-American actors and actresses who went before me in the difficult years, on whose shoulders I was privileged to stand to see where I might go.

 My love and my thanks to my wonderful, wonderful wife, my children, my grandchildren, my agent and friend Martin Baum. And finally, to those audience members around the world who have placed their trust in my judgment as an actor and filmmaker, I thank each of you for your support through the years. Thank you.

2001,74,2002-03-24,Kodak Theatre,Barbra Streisand,Honorary Award,": , director, producer, creator of , inspiration to independent and innovative filmmakers everywhere.",NA,NA,Robert Redford Actor Sundance,"ROBERT REDFORD:
 Thank you. [To presenter Barbra Streisand:] I guess this is a sequel, huh, Babs?

 Well, Barbra's right, I am shy. It's a funny kind of business to be shy in, but [I] certainly feel that way tonight. But I think there certainly is a word of appreciation in order for being honored in such a way. You know, much of what happens here tonight is probably going to be forgotten in a week or so. But what's not going to be forgotten is what it means to those of us who are receiving awards or being honored tonight, and to those close to us. For those people, it can be the moment of a lifetime. So in my appreciation, I'd like to say what it means for me.

 I've spent most of my life just focused on the road ahead, not looking back. But now tonight, I'm seeing in the rear view mirror that there is something I've not thought about much, called history. And what moves me tonight is that I'm being joined by colleagues and peers to reflect on that history. There really are only two areas. One is my personal work, which is the most important to me. And the other is trying to put something back into an industry that's been good to me. And of course Sundance is a manifestation of that. And the result, well, a grand, grand collaboration of artists and colleagues who have joined to support and help give a voice to new artists. To those people who have supported us along the way, who have believed and participated, tonight I would really like to thank you deeply.

 We have a great industry and we all know that. We're here because we know it, we love it. It's a solid and healthy industry. But even though it is, I really believe it's going to be important in the years to come to make sure that we embrace the risks as well as the sure things, to make sure the freedom of artistic expression is nurtured and kept alive, because I believe that in keeping diversity alive it will help keep our industry alive. As we can see of late the world around us is in a sea change. It's just simply not the same world anymore. As we all struggle to find our way with it, to get a grip, to make sense out of the chaos and the destruction and the tragedy, one word that emerges is the word ""freedom""...its importance, its rarity and how fortunate we are to have it. To be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us as artists to tell our stories in our own way about the human condition, the complexities of life, the world around us, is a gift, and not one to be taken lightly. And I think the glory of art is that it can not only survive change, it can lead it. As an artist I just can't think of a better life than the one that I've been blessed with. It's just a great ride with many wonderful relationships and experiences along the way, and it's a ride I hope to continue.

 So tonight, I want to acknowledge my family, my love for them, my lady, the Academy and all of you for giving me this honor. Thank you.

 [Kisses presenter Halle Berry] I bet they didn't tell you that was in the gift bag.

 Oh my God. Thank you. Thank you, really. Oh my goodness. It doesn't come out in slow motion, but it doesn't really ring a bell--the name. I didn't know my name when you said that. This Adrien? Okay.

 I haven't really written a speech because every time I wrote a speech for the past one of these things I didn't win. But, you know, there comes a time in life when everything seems to make sense and this is not one of those times. What I do know, though, is that I've never felt this much love and encouragement from my peers and from people I admire and from complete strangers. And it means a great deal to me. And if it weren't for the insomnia and those sudden panic attacks, this has been an amazing, amazing journey.

 I have to thank--they're already flashing time's up--I have to thank my mother and father, most importantly, for all the creativity and the encouragement. And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.

 What can I say? This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman. And this is a tribute to his survival. I'd like to thank Roman Polanski for the role of a lifetime. And for those of you who have seen the film and sat through the credits, you know there are just too many people to thank individually. I would not be here without all their efforts. And I thank them. And everyone worked extremely hard to make this film. And I have to thank Focus Features for getting us out there. To my longtime friend, manager, agent, consigliere, Joanne Colonna. Everybody at The Firm, PMK/HBH. And you know...[music plays]. Wait one second. One second, please, one second. Cut it out, cut it out. I get one shot at this. I'm sorry. I didn't say more than five names I don't think, but...

 This is, you know, it fills me with great joy, but I am also filled with a lot of sadness tonight because I'm accepting an award at such a strange time. And, you know, my experiences in making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people at times of war, and the repercussions of war. And whomever you believe in, if it's God or Allah, may He watch over you. And let's pray for a peaceful and swift resolution. Thank you. And I have a friend from Queens who's a soldier in Kuwait right now, Tommy Zarabinski. And I hope you and your boys make it back real soon. God bless you, guys. I love you. Thank you very much.

 I do have to say it was, why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honor that. And it is a tradition that needs to be upheld. At the same time you say there is a lot of problems in the world. And since 9/11 there's been a lot of pain, in terms of families losing people, and now with the war, families losing people. And God bless them. And I am standing here in front of my mother and my daughter and my whole life I've wanted to make my mother proud. And now I want to make my daughter proud. So thank you.

The Actors' Gang in ""Embedded"" in New York, thank you so much for putting up with me being here.

 And I would like to say one more thing. In this movie I play a victim of abuse and violence, and if you are out there and are a person that has had that tragedy befall you, there is no shame and no weakness in seeking help and counseling. It is sometimes the strongest thing that you can do to stop the cycle of violence. Thank you.

Fantasy is an F-word that hopefully the five second delay won't do anything with. I just want to say a very few quick words especially to the people of New Zealand and the government of New Zealand and the city councils and everybody who supported us the length and breadth of the country--Billy Crystal is welcome to come and make a film in New Zealand any time he wants. A special thanks to Peter Nelson and Ken Kamins, who were with me right from the days of ""Bad Taste"" and ""Meet the Feebles,"" which were wisely overlooked by the Academy at that time. And I especially want to pay tribute to our wonderful producer Barrie Osborne. And I'd please like him to say a few words.

 BARRIE M. OSBORNE:
 It's a great honor to be here. I started out in the business thirty-five years ago getting people coffee. And I wonder if the fact that I dated Billy Crystal's cousin so many years ago has anything to do with this. But it is really a great pleasure to be in such great company--uh-oh, I'm in trouble now--to be nominated with these four other great films, and after these many years to receive this award is really a thrill for all of us and we all thank the Academy. It's really a tribute to the talents of all the people, both in front of the camera and behind the camera, that we win this award. I want to thank in particular my partner Carol, my beautiful daughter Danielle, and my eighty-seven-year-old dad who's out there in the back somewhere here to celebrate this with us. I want to thank also J.R.R. Tolkien, and also the fans that supported us on this journey. And of course Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne, whose courageous venture allowed us to make this film and their support throughout the journey. And Mark Ordesky, who worked alongside of us throughout and became a great friend. And of course to Peter Jackson, who was never satisfied with 100 percent, but by his example of pushing for 110 percent, he inspired all of us to do our utmost to make these films and bring them to the screen. And finally, to Weta, who is in Chicago [Sports Café] in Wellington, New Zealand, and to the production team, who are in the Port Nicholson Yacht Club--it's time to celebrate.

And he used to come out with a shovel and scoop up the elephant poop. And as he did he sang ""There's No Business Like Show Business."" And then there was a confused Italian actor that we tried to get him to understand what this okay sign [makes ""okay"" hand sign] meant in our vernacular. Okay. We just said, just do that [makes ""okay"" hand sign]. And he always did this [makes wrong hand sign]. And so we decided better we conform to him than he to us. So from then on, on the set, I would say, get the shot, Phil? [Makes wrong hand sign]. Cutting room: you drop a couple frames just before the alligator swallows the chimp, Ralphie? [Makes wrong hand sign]. Do you think Audrey can sing it, Henry? [Makes wrong hand sign].

 This is probably going to be the toughest part of this speech. My daughter shares my grandmother's name: Marie. My grandmother's name is Estelle Marie Talley. And she's not here tonight. And this is going to be the toughest part. But she was my first acting teacher. She told me, ""Stand up straight. Put your shoulders back. Act like you got some sense."" We would go places and I would wild out, and she says, ""Act like you've been somewhere."" And then when I would act the fool, she would beat me. She would whup me. And she could get an Oscar for the way she whupped me because she was great at it. And after she whipped me, she would talk to me and tell me why she whipped me, said, ""I want you to be a southern gentleman."" And she still talks to me now; only now she talks to me in my dreams. And I can't wait to go to sleep tonight because we got a lot to talk about. I love you.

 Thank you so much. Marty, thank you for your kind introduction, and to Jon Bloom for that wonderful film by the way. As many of you know, Marty's Film Foundation has been a leader in the film preservation movement, just as Jean Hersholt was a leader in the Motion Picture & Television Fund. And interestingly enough, he contributed the land on which our hospital, retirement community and Alzheimer's unit were built. So, there's a real connection there.

 As for film preservation, I must give credit to the six board chairmen [and] seven production heads during my twenty-five years at MGM who either backed our endeavors or weren't quite sure what we were doing so let it happen anyway. And then came Ted Turner and his cohorts in Atlanta, who understood the importance of all this and kept it going when funds were pretty short. Preservation and restoration are now led by the studios and organizations nationwide such as The Museum of Modern Art and Eastman House in New York, UCLA and our own Academy Archives here in Los Angeles, and most particularly, the Library of Congress. And as I thank the Academy's Board of Governors for this great honor, I want to remind all of you that the Academy itself, namely you, support film preservation and health care through both the Motion Picture & Television Fund and the National Film Preservation Foundation. So, we sincerely thank you.

 And of course, most importantly, thanks to my family, all of whom are here tonight. My children Patty and Larry, daughter-in-law Jennifer, sister Florence, granddaughters Natasha and Anna. And most especially, my wife of fifty-two-and-a-half years, Pauline. Fifty-two-and-a-half years; and they say nothing lasts in Hollywood? Well, love really does, ""Taking Care of Our Own"" does, and the art of film does if we properly preserve it. So I'm going to keep at it and hope you will continue your support. Thank you very, very much.

 Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind and I thank you. From the time I did my first movie, I, needless to say, like everyone else, started to fantasize about Oscar. And I was lucky enough to be nominated on the first movie, so I started to fantasize about the speech. And I was a real smart aleck, and I thought I would say something like, ""I don't want to thank anybody; I did it alone."" It wasn't true, but I thought it would be a way of getting a little attention.

 When Frank Pierson called me about receiving this one, of course I started thinking about the speech again. And I realized that if I totaled up all of the ""thank yous"" that I've heard in all of these years, I wouldn't be able to thank all the people that I really want to. I'm not just talking about the glorious talents that I've worked with on both sides of the camera, but there are so many with whom I've never even worked that I owe so much. I mean, how do I thank Spielberg and Scorsese and Coppola? How do I thank Jean Vigo, and Carl Dreyer, and Willy Wyler, and Kurosawa, and Buster Keaton? And I'm not mentioning the ones that I really stole from. What about the Epsteins for writing a line like, ""Here's lookin' at you, kid?"" Or Wilder and Diamond for, ""Well, nobody's perfect."" Or Faragoh for, ""Mother of God, is this the end of Rico?""

 So, what I guess it comes down to is I'd like to thank the movies. I know that sounds general, but it's very real to me. I've got the best job in the best profession in the world, so I just want to thank all of it.

 And of course, the ones who've paid more dues than I have: Thank you Piedy, Amy, Jenny. See you later.

 Listen, I don't quite know how you compare art. You look at these performances this year, of these actors, and unless we all did the same role—everybody put on a bat suit, we'll all try that—unless we all did the same role, I don't know how you compare it. They are stellar performances and wonderful work, and I'm honored, truly honored to be up here.

 And finally, I would say that, you know, we are a little bit out of touch in Hollywood every once in a while, I think. It's probably a good thing. We're the ones who talked about AIDS when it was just being whispered, and we talked about civil rights when it wasn't really popular. And we, you know, we bring up subjects, we are the ones—this Academy, this group of people gave Hattie McDaniel an Oscar in 1939 when blacks were still sitting in the backs of theaters.

And T Bone Burnett for helping me realize my lifelong dream of being a country music singer; thank you, T Bone. And I want to say thank you to Joaquin Phoenix who just put his heart and soul into this performance. His commitment and passion for this character and for this performance was just remarkable and I feel so lucky to have gone on this journey with you.

 I am so blessed to have my family here tonight. My mother and my father are here. And I just want to say thank you so much for everything, for being so proud of me. It didn't matter if I was making my bed or making a movie, they never hesitated to say how proud they were of me and that means so very much to a child. So thank you, Mom and Dad. I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband and my two children—who should be going to bed—and thank you for loving me so much and supporting me. And I want to say that my grandmother was one of the biggest inspirations in my life. She taught me how to be a real woman, to have strength and self respect, and to never give those things away. And those are a lot of qualities I saw in June Carter. And people used to ask June how she was doing, and she used to say: ""I'm just trying to matter."" And I know what she means. You know, I'm just trying to matter and live a good life and make work that means something to somebody. And you have all made me feel that I might have accomplished that tonight. So thank you so much for this honor.

 Thank you so much to the Academy for this tremendous, tremendous honor. I share it with others: Ralph Fiennes, my luminous acting partner; Fernando Meirelles, our director, who is brimming over with such humanity; and our dignified, sensitive producer, Simon Channing Williams; and of course, John le Carré, who wrote this unflinching, angry story. And he really paid tribute to the people who are willing to risk their own lives to fight injustice, and they're greater men and women than I. But thank you, thank you so much. Thank you.

To Bill Pohlad, Tory Metzger, Ira Schreck, Joe Dapello, many thanks. And a special thanks to David Lee. And thanks to my wife Jane Lin and my boys Han and Mason. I love you.

 Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. I've got a lot to say, and they've got a clock on me.

 I want to thank everybody for this, the Academy. I was really honored and moved to accept this award. When the news first came to me about it, I was caught kind of off guard. I always thought this type of award meant that it was over. And then it dawned on me that I was busy in rehearsals on a play that I'm doing in London right now. It opened last night, Arthur Miller's last play, ""Resurrection Blues."" I was doing an interview for my new film that I just finished, ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" which will come out in the summer. And I realized that it's not over. Of course I was happy and thrilled, and thrilled to accept this award. And I look at it as a nod to all of my films because, to me, I've just made one long film. And I know some of you have liked some of the sections, and others you.... Anyway, it's alright.

 And I want to thank all of the people that have worked on all my pictures so hard, the brilliant actors, the amazing crews. And I can't name them all so I'm going to name a doctor who is taking care of me, Jody Kaplan*. So she represents everybody who have supported me and made it possible.

 I've always said that making a film is like making a sandcastle at the beach. You invite your friends and you get them down there and you build this beautiful structure, several of you, and then you sit back and watch the tide come in. Have a drink, watch the tide come in and the ocean just takes it away. And that sandcastle remains in your mind. Now I've built about forty of them, and I never tire of it. No other filmmaker has gotten a better shake than I have. I'm very fortunate in my career. I've never had to direct a film I didn't choose or develop. I love filmmaking. It has given me an entree to the world and to the human condition and for that I'm forever grateful.

 Finally I'd like to thank my family—you're all up there, all of them, almost—for their love and support through the years. And most importantly, I want to thank and applaud my wife Kathryn Reed Altman, without whom I wouldn't be here today. I love you, Trixie. Thank you.

 Oh, one more thing. I'm here, I think, under kind of false pretenses, and I think I have to become straight with you. Ten years ago, eleven years ago, I had a heart transplant. A total heart transplant. I got the heart of, I think, a young woman who was about in her late thirties, and so by that kind of calculation, you may be giving me this award too early. Because I think I've got about forty years left on it. And I intend to use it. Thank you very much. Thank you.

 Thank you. Thank you. Just a second, just a second. Okay. Take it [in], okay. I wrote something down because I thought if it would happen I would be a little overwhelmed and I am. So, okay.

 When I was a kid the only way that I saw movies was from the backseat of my family's car at the drive-in, and it wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies. So receiving this honor tonight tells me that it's possible, it is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in South Central L.A., in Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen. Because when I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us. Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it's a connection so strong, it's a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.

 So I want to thank my fellow believers in ""The Last King of Scotland."" I want to thank Peter, Jeremy, Andrea, Lisa, Charles, Kevin, James McAvoy, Kerry, Stephen, Fox, DNA, Channel Four. I want to thank the people of Uganda, who helped this film have a spirit. And finally, I want to thank my mom and my dad; I want to thank my wife Keisha, my children, my ancestors who continue to guide my steps, and God, God who believes in us all and who's given me this moment in this lifetime that I will hopefully carry to the end of my lifetime into the next lifetime. Thank you.

 I know you're not supposed to read but I'd be totally incoherent if I didn't. It's handwritten, it's short.

 More than anything I am deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth and connection. Acting for me has always been and always will be a team sport. I cannot work at all unless I feel a spirit of unity around me. So my main sense of gratitude goes to the entire cast and crew and production team of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for creating the same sense of joy and trust and community that the film speaks about.

 I'd like to thank the Academy, Fox Searchlight, my wife Suzanne, my sons Adam, Matthew and Tony for their endless support. My representation: Estelle, Lee, Frank and Melody. And for the great teachers I've had throughout my life, both in and out of the profession. Thank you very much.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the result of this narrative that adds up to, in finding the look of the movie and the narrative to continue into this incredible story that unfolds. The creative freedom that was needed to tell the story and to preserve the integrity of the story and the point of view is what was more important for us in this movie.

 Oh my God! I made a comedy musical about Israelis and Palestinians that takes place between two falafel stands in the West Bank. And it's a movie about peace and about hope, and to be able to get this award just goes to show that there are so many other people out there who support that notion and that when it comes to the situation between Israelis and Palastinians, hope is not hopeless.

 And on another note, I know a lot of people in America are probably watching and asking, ""What are the short films?"" Well, a lot of them are made by directors who are trying to get noticed, and I think in a lot of ways we represent the little guy because we don't have big studios behind us or big name actors or a lot of times the budgets we need, and it relies on perseverance and stick-to-itiveness and hustle and a dedication and a loyalty from a cast and crew who are doing it for pennies if not for nothing. So I'd be remiss if I were to take this award and not thank my co-writer Kim Ray, my producers Pascal Vaguelsy, Amy Kim, Ashley Jordan, Ravi Malhotra, and my composer Yuval Ron. And last but not least, the two people who never doubted me even when I doubted myself, my mother who's here in the audience, Kathy, and my father Dan, who's watching. I love you. Thank you.

This is dedicated to two people who are no longer with us: Dilawar, the young Afghan taxi driver; and my father, a Navy interrogator who urged me to make this film because of his fury about what was being done to the rule of law. Let's hope we can turn this country around, move away from the dark side and back to the light. Thank you very much.

 Well, it's not possible for me to express my appreciation to the countless people who helped me on this great trip, this wonderful journey of being in the movies. But I can thank the members of the Board of Governors of the Academy, and to Nicole Kidman who so graciously introduced me.

 I would like to remember some of the old folk, like Hans Dreier, who took a chance and gave me my first job in the movies. And to Hitch, who also took a chance and gave me my first big film. And I also would like to remember that Hitch introduced me to the screenwriter Bess Taffel, who became my wife and my companion throughout this wonderful journey. I also would like to thank my children and grandchildren who supported me with their love and support, thank them.

 And to Norman Jewison who made moviemaking fun and much laughter while dealing with real subjects. And to Don Siegel, who cut to the chase and gave us truth. And with all of these there was my beginning at the USC School of Architecture and my great colleagues in the Art Directors Guild who supported me. And finally, to Jean Firstenberg who introduced me to the American Film Institute and the opportunity to give back to the next generation of storytellers.

 Since I've been around here for almost a century, I've noted a lot of conflicts, but there was one bright image in this whole life of ours, and that was the arts, and particularly the art of the moviemakers, of the moving image that we all love. So I have had the good fortune to be a part of this and I thank you all for being there for me. Thank you.

Producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks. And particularly, as all us actors know, our director either has the patience, talent and restraint to grant us a voice or they don't, and it goes from the beginning of the meeting through the cutting room. And there is no finer hands to be in than Gus Van Sant.

 And finally, for those--two last finallies. For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support. We've got to have equal rights for everyone. And there are, and there are these last two things. I'm very, very proud to live in a country that is willing to elect an elegant man president and a country who, for all its toughness, creates courageous artists, and this is in great due respect to all the nominees, but courageous artists who, despite a sensitivity that sometimes has brought enormous challenge, Mickey Rourke rises again and he is my brother.

Together we've been on an extraordinary, an extraordinary journey. When we started out we had no stars, we had no power or muscle, we didn't have enough money, really, to do what we wanted to do. But what we had was a script that inspired mad love in everyone who read it. We had a genius for a director. We had a cast and a crew who were unwavering in their commitment and whose talents are up on the screen for all of you to see. We had partners in Film4, in Celador, in Pathé and Fox Searchlight who had the courage to support us. And we had a shared love for the extraordinary city of Mumbai where we made the movie. Most of all we had passion and we had belief. And our film shows that if you have those two things, truly anything is possible. I want to thank, on a personal note, my mum and my dad for all their love and support over the years. I want to thank my girl, Saskia Mulder, who is my partner in crime and the light in my life.

And he put this script in front of me and he said, ""This is where we're going, but we're going the other way."" So Brad Pitt helped me on board and Diane Kruger was there. And Mélanie Laurent and Denis Menochet and Bob Richardson, Sally Menke, and Adam Schweitzer and Lisa Kasteler. And everybody helped me find a place. Universal and The Weinstein Company and ICM.

Four of them, that I've fallen deeply in love with, I share this night with and I share this award with. Gabby, I love you so much. You are exquisite. You are beyond words to me. Carey, your grace and your elegance and your beauty and your talent makes me sick. Helen, I feel like we are family, through(?) family, and I don't have the words to express just what I think of you. And Meryl, you know what I think of you, and you are such a good kisser.

 I have so many people to thank for my good fortune in this lifetime, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I know. To the family that allowed me to play them, the Tuohy family. I know they're in here and you'll probably hear her in a minute... Maybe not. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different: John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you. To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago. I'm still holding a grudge.

 But there's so many people to thank; not enough time. So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from. Those moms and parents never get thanked. I, in particular, failed to thank one. So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do. For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be. She said to be an artist you had to practice every day. And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else. We are all deserving of love. So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep.

And, you know, we had this fantasy of making our film our way with the talent that we hoped to have, and hopefully we would find a distributor and somebody might even like the movie. So to be standing here, this was really, truly, honestly never part of anything we even imagined in our wildest dreams. So thank you so much to each and every member of the Academy for really honoring us beyond anything we could've imagined.

 GREG SHAPIRO:
 Thank you to the Academy. This is really unreal and extremely humbling. We also have to thank our intrepid financier and fellow producer, Nicolas Chartier, who bet on this movie when no one else would. The incredible support that we got from CAA, particularly Joel Lubin, Roeg Sutherland, Brian Siberell. Our entire cast and crew, and our fearless director.

 MARK BOAL:
 Our fearless director. And also, we owe a deep debt of gratitude, by the way, to Summit Entertainment and Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger for distributing this film. And thank you, Mom. I forgot to thank you before.

 KATHRYN BIGELOW:
 I was just gonna reiterate that with Rob and Patrick, who took a very brave shot with this movie, and we owe them dearly. And perhaps one more dedication: To men and women all over the world who, sorry to reiterate, but wear a uniform. But even not just the military – hazmat, emergency, firemen. You know, they're there for us and we're there for them. Thank you. Thank you.

 Good evening. It doesn't look like, but it's a French film. Sorry about the accent. I'm the producer of the film, so I have to thank the three thousand non-official sponsors that appeared in the film. And I have to assure them that no logos were harmed during the making of the project.

 This award has to be shared with the incredible people who made the film, all the team, and especially the three directors that are with us in the theater tonight: François Alaux, Hervé de Crécy and Ludovic Houplain. You can applaud them, the directors. Thanks for them. They have been working for a very, very long time on this film. It took, like, six years to make this sixteen minutes, so I hope to come back here with a long feature film in about thirty-six years. Thank you very much. Bon soir.

And most of all, to one extraordinary individual and visionary filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. This belongs to you.

 [Yells; laughs.] Oh my heavens, I can't believe it. [Clutching the Oscar:] A man at last! [Laughs.] Well this is quite an event, I must say. This was something I never expected. I was in total shock when I got the call, and the shock has not quite worn off, I have to say.

 I've been very lucky in my life, probably luckier than I deserve. But to, at the age of nineteen, have been chosen by Howard Hawks to work in a film with a man named Humphrey Bogart, didn't thrill me too much when I heard it. I thought, Bogart, God...dese dem and dose guys, can't, you know... I thought that was not for me. He had said, ""Maybe Cary Grant."" I said, ""Well! Now you're talking."" But it ended up being Bogart; that was my great luck. Because he was not only a wonderful actor, but he was an extraordinary man. And he gave me a life and he changed my life. And he told me about all the ins and outs and ups and downs, of which there were many. And not so many downs with him. And from then on, I must say, for as many years as, I cannot believe sixty years, but it has been that long. [Laughs.] It's amazing, isn't it? Considering how young I am. Anyway. Miracles will never cease.

 The fact is that I've had the great good fortune of not only being shown the way by Bogie, and having two wonderful children who are right here, Steve and Leslie, right here with me, but in also being able to work with some of the best leading men in this business. And have forged the greatest friendships with Greg Peck, who I miss very much and love very dearly. And his wife got in the way, but what are you gonna do? [Laughs.] And anyway. Veronique, hello! [Laughs.]

 Anyway, I really was lucky. I really did work with, with Kirk – and he said, ""Never fear,"" he said to me backstage, ""Never fear, Kirk is here."" Confidence is a great thing, isn't it? But Kirk, and Duke Wayne, surprisingly had a marvelous relationship with him for two movies. And Greg. It's quite amazing the people that I've worked with. I've worked with Hank Fonda and met – unfortunately not really Jimmy Stewart, but some of the all-time all-time greats. And was directed by not only Howard Hawks, who was a marvelous director, a great movie director, but John Huston, of course, who was the great director and who showed me the way, and tripped me a few times en route. But he was a jokester, and because – and he loved to laugh, and he had an incredible laugh so one could hardly blame him.

 But anyway, not to tell you the entire story of my life, I just must say that I have to thank the Academy and I'm very grateful that they think I'm deserving of this honor. And as I repeat, I certainly did not expect to receive it, but I do welcome it. And the thought when I get home that I'm gonna have a two-legged man in my room is so exciting I can hardly stand it. So I would like to thank all of you, and I thank them. And, what else can I say? It's what I feel, and I feel very emotional and I feel very grateful, and not least of all that I'm still alive. I mean after all, some of you are surprised, aren't you? Nevertheless I am, and I'm here to stay. You better get used to the idea. Thank you very much.

 Needless to say I'm delighted to accept this Oscar personally, but I'd also like to accept it on behalf of my wife Julie, who's been my producing partner for many years, and also on behalf of those who've worked in the field in which I've spent most of my career, the independent filmmakers.

 We all work in what I think is the only true modern art form. All other arts had their origins in antiquity and are therefore, to a certain extent, static. Motion pictures encompass movement, which is one of the key characteristics of our day, and for that reason they are modern. There's another reason as well. And the reason is that traditional art has been done, let us say, by composers, writers, poets, painters, who could create their art individually. Motion pictures require, the filmmaker requires a cast and a crew, and they must be paid. As a result our art is somewhat compromised. We're compromised between art and business and I think that represents something of the compromised world in which we live.

 I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances. Many of my friends and compatriots and people who've started with me are here tonight, and they've all succeeded. Some of them succeeded to an extraordinary degree. And I believe they've succeeded because they had the courage to take chances, to gamble. But they gambled because they knew the odds were with them; they knew they had the ability to create what they wanted to make. It's very easy for a major studio or somebody else to repeat their successes, to spend vast amounts of money on remakes, on special effects-driven tentpole franchise films. But I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble. So I say to you: Keep gambling, keep taking chances. Thank you.

 Vilmos [Zsigmond] said I shouldn't drop this [referring to the Oscar], so I'm gonna put it down I think. I don't think I should be up here without a bulletproof vest on after Caleb's thing.

 Thank you very much. I have one disappointment. I've done a lot of things in this business, but I've never worked for Roger Corman. And after I thought about it, it's the best thing that ever happened to him. I can't see too well anymore, unfortunately [pulling out his notes]; I made my own little thing up here.

 My life in this business has been a series of, sort of great encounters, and they have been an embarrassment of riches as they say. I've always had an opportunity to do what I want, and the way I want, and I've always worked with the people that have given me that opportunity. In retrospect, I think probably every good thing that's ever happened to me happened because of another person. And fifty-four years ago, I met this darling girl and married her, had three kids, now five grandchildren, and along the way I met this remarkable group of directors, producers, very fine actors, and very fine technicians who extended themselves for me. And I can never really give them back what they gave to me; I had the best of it.

 To the Academy, thank you very much. I really appreciate this. And a remark on a lighter vein. All the beautiful women that I worked with in this business that were terrified of looking like Marlon Brando; it's okay, it's over now. You're safe. And to all of you, do your best, take care of your kids. Thank you very much.

 I have a feeling my career has just peaked. My deepest thanks to the Academy. I'm afraid I have to warn you that I'm experiencing stirrings, somewhere in the upper abdominals, which are threatening to form themselves into dance moves which, joyous as they may be for me, it would be extremely problematic if they make it to my legs before I get offstage. So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude.

 First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this. All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are. Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be. And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen: Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation.

 And all the people who have been rooting for me back home. Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones. And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this. And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family. And Livia, for putting up with my fleeting delusions of royalty and who I hold responsible for this, and for really everything that's good that's happened since I met her. Now, if you'll all excuse me I have some impulses I have to tend to backstage. Thank you very much [unintelligible].

 Thank you to the Academy and especially to my fellow nominees who are just so much fun to sit with at the, tonight and have been so supportive. It's great to be part of such a great group of people. The story ""Alice in Wonderland"" was described by its publisher in 1865 as a story valued for its rare imagination, priceless humor, and power to transport the reader into a world of pure fantasy; a gift to us all. The heart of any movie lies with the director and I've been incredibly lucky on this and many films to work with the singular Tim Burton. Tim's imagination along with the amazing cast – Johnny's incandescent ""Hatter,"" Mia's ""Alice"" for all girls all times, Helena's the fearless, big-headed queen, and our crystalline snowflake princess Anne Hathaway – made my job a delight. We had the support of a production team headed by Richard Zanuck and Katterli Frauenfelder, supported by Joe Roth, Suzanne and Jen Todd, and Disney, but I couldn't have done it without my team: Christine Cantella and my entire group.

Now she's never been invited to a play reading in her entire life before. She almost didn't go because it didn't sound exactly promising, but thank god she did because she came home, rang me up and said, ""Tom, I think I found your next film.""

At the Academy, at the lunch they have for the nominees, where they have like a Randy Newman chicken by this time, the, Mr. Mischer said that it's not really good television to take a list out of your pocket and thank a lot of people. It's not my style anyway, but it is in this case. I mean, to have worked for Pixar doing the six pictures I've done, on this one Lee Unkrich and worked with Mitchell Froom, Chris Montan at Disney. I just have to thank these people. I don't want to; I want to be good television so badly, as you can see. I've been on this show any number of times and I've slowed it down almost every time. No wonder they, they only nominate four songs? There's not one—what about cinematography? It says five, you know. You could find a fifth song from someone. But hell with it! I thank—it might have beat me. Anyway, I thank you all very much for this. The Academy has been enormously kind to me as has the Music Branch. And I love you all. Thank you very much.

 Thank you. It's impossible to describe what it feels like to be handed the same award that was given to Paddy Chayefsky thirty-five years ago for another movie with ""network"" in the title. His was an original screenplay; this is an adaptation of a book by Ben Mezrich, so I'm accepting this on his behalf as well. There are a lot of people who've worked hard in my corner for a long time and it seems like the right moment to thank them: my assistant Lauren Lohman; my researcher Ian Reichbach; my long suffering press rep, Joy Fehily, and all the women of Prime; Rich Heller, Bill Tanner, Andy Forshay*; my agents Ari Emanuel and Jason Spitz, who never blow my cover and reveal that I would happily do this for free; and my mom and dad, who made a life for me where I get to be a part of nights like this.

 I wrote this movie but David Fincher made this movie, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness. Someone this talented has no business being the nicest guy in the world, but he is, and he made the movie of any screenwriter's dreams. He had help from Amy Pascal, Michael Lynton and everyone at Sony whose only mandate was to make it good. From Dana Brunetti, Ceán Chaffin, Mike De Luca, and America's best living film producer, Scott Rudin. And from Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Armie Hammer again, Rashida Jones, Rooney Mara, and a cast and crew that followed their leader's example: that good enough was never good enough. This movie is going to be a source of pride for me every day for the rest of my life. That is an un-repayable gift. All I can say is thank you.

2010,83,2010-11-13,"The Governors Awards (Grand Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","James Karen, Lindsay Doran, Martin Scorsese (on film), Kevin Spacey",Honorary Award,for the wise and devoted chronicling of the cinematic parade.,NA,NA,Kevin Brownlow,"KEVIN BROWNLOW:
 If you've ever wondered what reflected glory looks like, this is it. On behalf of all those film historians, film preservationists, and film collectors... I hear an intake of breath. Not so long ago film collectors were endangered in this town by a knock on the door from the FBI. I hope you have learnt that we were not your enemies. But my god, your predecessors did a terrible job of preserving the silent era. Historian David Pierce is about to reveal 73 percent has been destroyed. Now, that's like a publisher taking Tolstoy, Dickens, Scott Fitzgerald, despulping every copy, and you can't even see the manuscript because they've burnt that as well. So it's up to us to do our damnedest to find the films that your predecessors destroyed and bring them back into the canon. An awful lot is being done as you know – the recent find in New Zealand, the recent generosity from Russia – but when I think of some of the titles that are gone it's really heartbreaking.

 Now, I was told when I started this business that silent films were a complete waste of time. They were jerky, flickery, ludicrously badly acted and appallingly photographed. And I couldn't understand it because I was already a film collector and what I saw in beautiful prints, although sometimes abridged, were... I was struck by the freshness, the vitality, the innovation and the exquisite photography. Ah, and I really do regret the loss of black and white. It was a beautiful medium. It called upon you to do some work, like silent film itself you have to supply the voices and sound effects, and with black and white you supply everything that the film suggested and therefore you become part of the creative process and it means that much more.

 Now, film is a collaborative medium and I took it to its extremes. I think I've worked on practically everything with a partner. My wife, of course, of forty-one years. She is wearing tonight jewelry given her by Alice Terry. Match that! Then there are my partners: Andrew Mollo, twelve years; David Gill, twenty-three years, alas he died in '97; and I'd better not leave out my current producer, Patrick Stanbury; and Christopher Bird, the most recent co-director.

 I've had a very fortunate life as you can guess. And to give you an example: I was very impressed by the feature comedies of Harold Lloyd. He seemed... If I wanted to convert someone to silent films I just ran them a Lloyd picture. That's all you had to do. But you could not get hold of them. He kept such close grasp that we were reduced to two for a long time, and I knew the fellow who had those two but he wouldn't even consider exchanging or selling them. Well, I wrote a fan letter to Harold Lloyd, and I was very disappointed. He didn't answer. Celebrities don't, you know. And I was dozing one Sunday morning and I imagined that I had at last gone to Hollywood, and I was being shown around the Motion Picture Home by D.W. Griffith himself. And he said, ""Over there is a room with a great cameraman. Over there lives a very fine editor."" And at the end of the corridor the telephone rang. And in my head I started tracking forward, as one does, and I dissolved through and my telephone was ringing. So I went out into the hall and picked it up and a voice said, ""Kevin, you'll never guess who this is. It's Harold Lloyd."" He invited me to the Dorchester Hotel, and then began a long and extremely fruitful friendship. I loved him! Actually, he was so charming he should have been the original of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People.""

 And I became fascinated by what these people did. They were the most extraordinary people I've ever met in my life, when I finally got to America and met them en masse. It was not just the stars, but the cameramen, the art directors and even the title writers. I remember one of them, Monty Brice, told me that his first title writing job he was literally taken off the golf course. Somebody had fallen ill; none of the title writers were getting anywhere near a good joke. And so he came in in his rather loud knickerbockers, and these tough ex-newspapermen all looked at him and said, ""That's your title writing outfit, huh?"" And he said... he had no idea. What he had to produce was a title which suggested that Al St. John had left for the city, had failed in everything he'd done and was returning. He said to me, ""God send me a flash. I said, 'How 'bout this boys: Al left home to set the world on fire but had to come back for more matches.'""

 Now, it is amazing what's turning up, and if you would only relax your copyright laws where silent films are concerned you would see an awful lot more suddenly appear. That has been one of the worst chains on this whole affair of ours to try and rescue the past of the cinema. And I'll just tell you one terrible story which sums it all up. And I've got the film that – well, I shouldn't admit this because it's probably copyright – but I have the film in which this appears. Junior Laemmle was in charge of the Collegians series at Universal. And there's a sporting event, a swimming event, which one college wins and they build bonfires and they come home and have a wild party, or come back to the college and have the wild party, setting the bonfires alight. But it doesn't burn, they don't burn strongly enough. And Junior Laemmle says, ""Pile on the silent negatives; we'll never need them again."" And on that note, that cautionary tale, they burnt beautifully. I'll leave you. Thank you.

 Thank you, Clint. Friends, family, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Academy: Thank you. Let me tell you a little about myself. As an actor I've played more bandits, thieves, killers, warlords, molesters, and mafiosi than you could shake a stick at. As a civilian I collect antique clocks, tell endless stories of my days as a medic in World War II, watch every tennis match, live for my family [and] daily mail, run the dishwasher, take pictures of faces in the bark of trees. I really have a penchant for a man named Josh Brolin. [Pointing:] There he is.

 Speaking of mail, sometimes I receive the most bizarre correspondence, ranging from an Englishman looking for help funding his mother's latest heart operation, to last year's letter from the Pope – really – gushing up to me for his favorite film was ""The Magnificent Seven."" I couldn't understand that, I kept killing people in there. And why not drop by for a visit the next time I'm in Rome. I didn't realize I had friends in such high places. I didn't even know I was joining the Academy for chrissake! On a more serious note, I'm deeply moved by this honor. Your recognition of my artistry makes something very [cl]ear to me: I don't act to live. I live to act.

 I have one last story to tell. Two young men were planning a gift for their elderly father's birthday so they decided to hire and send over a hooker. During negotiations she asks, ""How old is the birthday boy?"" ""Oh, he's in his nineties."" ""Oh, easy,"" she said, ""I can handle him easy."" So she goes over to the old man's house, knocks on his door. The old man opens it and says, ""Yes, what is it?"" So she smiles and says, ""I'm here to give you super sex."" And there's a slight pause, and he says, ""Alright, I'll take the soup.""

 Well, George [Lucas] is the closest thing I have to a younger brother, so you can imagine the affection and the pride I have in him. But there were so many... I'm about three or four or five years older than the wonderful generation that did so much, so I'm very proud of them. And the fact that this is the Thalberg Award is, the significance is not lost on me. Because this is an award for producing. This is not about my own writing and my own filmmaking, but this is about the talent that I came to really value. And it's more about ""American Graffiti"" and ""The Black Stallion"" and ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" and I could go on, about ""Napoleon"" performed in the Radio City Music Hall with a live orchestra. That happened because I'd always heard from my father that in the days when he was a boy, when he went to the movies to see ""Don Juan"" or ""The Thief of Bagdad,"" that there was a symphony orchestra. And I said, gee, I'd love to see that. And the way to see it was to take the ""Napoleon"" restoration and get a full-out symphony orchestra and perform it. And it was a wonderful hit. It was riveting. And I'm so proud of the fact that that tradition of once again combining live music with the great silent films, or with any film, has become really something that we can see.

 I don't have any words prepared. In fact, I'm shooting a picture, and last night – we're shooting nights, so I went to bed around four in the morning last night. And I said, well, I'll just get up and thank everyone for this honor. I remember seeing the Thalberg Award given and thought, wow, that's fantastic. And in a way, although I still consider myself a relatively young person, I'm one of the few people you'll meet today who actually worked for Jack Warner and had him say, ""No fog on the lake!"" Or Sam Goldwyn when he said to me, you know, [imitating:] ""Your films, I like your films for the spontinuity"" [purposefully mispronounces], he said to me. So I had the pleasure – I do a great Samuel Goldwyn, as does Warren [Beatty]. He said to me, Samuel Goldwyn said to me, he said [imitating:] ""What are you doing? You're a Goldwyn Scholar. You're so great."" I said, well I want to direct, too. [Imitating:] ""Direct? You should be a writer. Writer, you are a writer. You're a great writer. Write! Write! Write!"" So a year later I made a film, and I got a letter: Mr. Goldwyn would like to see you. He said, [imitating:] ""Oh, you're a Goldwyn Scholar –"" This is really the way he talked, by the way, I'm not... [Imitating:] ""You're a Goldwyn Scholar."" He said, ""What are you doing?"" I said, well, I'm thinking of writing a new film. [Imitating:] ""Writing? You're a director now! Writers are nothing. Direct! Direct! Direct!"" So, you know, Adolph Zukor, Darryl Zanuck, who incidentally, as was said, was the first winner of the Thalberg Award, and I think he won it more than once as a matter of fact. So I have a great love of the original Hollywood tradition, certainly going back to the silents which were some of the most beautiful movies ever made. Murnau, by the way, had said himself, he said, ""The coming of sound to movies was inevitable, but it came too soon."" It came too soon, which there is some truth in. Those were beautiful films.

 I, you know, I'm so proud of my family: my wife of forty-eight years, Eleanor, who's here; my fabulous children. I made a very wise decision when I was a young guy. I said to my wife, if I ever go away for more than two weeks I want to take the kids out of school – imagine that today – take the kids out of school. I'm taking them with me. And we always did, and as a result we had our family together through all of those adventures in the Philippines and what have you. So, and then of course the other children in the Schwartzman family, and of course in, I can't say the Cage family, but we're very proud of Nicolas as you can imagine. So I could tell you lots of stories but I haven't prepared any notes or anything other than to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And my admiration for the tradition of Irving Thalberg and, of course, of the fantastic producers who have won it, and not the least of it is Dino. You know, what a loss, to lose... [imitating:] ""Dino, eh. You know, Francis..."" I don't do Dino so well. I think Warren does Dino. At any rate, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I thank my family. I thank my friends. So many of my friends are here tonight and people I've worked with, my colleagues, and the people whose films I've admired. Thank you so much. Thank you.

To the artists, ""Crash"" McCreery, Jim Byrkit, Hal Hickel, Tim Alexander, John Knoll, everybody at Blind Wink and ILM who put so much passion into every frame.

Blige, Alec Baldwin, Glenn Close, Vanessa Redgrave (in London), Ben Kingsley (in London)",Honorary Award,for his legacy of consistent excellence and uncommon versatility.,NA,NA,James Earl Jones,"JAMES EARL JONES:
 [Laughs] Thank you. I know you have been very kind to stay with us, you're a great audience this afternoon. I just wanna ask you a question: If an actor's nightmare is being on stage buck naked and not knowing his lines... what the heck do you call this?

 [Laughs] I mean, look at this! I've been on this stage, with a great audience - and thank you. I had my clothes on, I knew my words, and then out from the wings steps Sir Ben Kingsley, and he hands me an Oscar! Frankly... frankly, what the heck else would you call that but an actor's wet dream? [Laughs]

 And aside from that, how do I feel? Well, I'm more than flabbergasted. There's a word I've learned here in Britain. They'd say, ""I'm gobsmacked!"" [Laughs] And that's the only word that I can think of that's appropriate for this improbable moment in my life. Improbable because, well, let's start with my introduction to motion pictures. Four years old, sitting on a bench in the dark in Mississippi. Two storekeepers have taken a bedsheet and stretched it between their stores. One sells popcorn, the other sells soda pop. Is that familiar? And when those images start emitting sound on that bedsheet, and the shootouts and the fisticuffs start, I simply can't handle it. And I dive under the bench in terror, begging, screaming, ""Make 'em stop! Somebody make 'em stop doing that.""

 Well, I can't make 'em stop so eventually I joined them. And for half a century now, being a journeyman actor in my own fashion, I still spend more time on [taps the stage with his foot] boards like these than in front of cameras like those [pointing to the back of the room]. I sometimes feel like that lone wolf lurking around the, outside the glow of the cinema campfire, lurching in to snatch a morsel of movie now and then. Now sometimes those morsels I'm quite proud of. But you cannot be a cinema actor and conduct your career like I've done, and not end up in some of the worst movies ever committed to celluloid. But I want to tell you something [laughs], I want to tell you something. I so cherish them that I refuse to name them. You'll just have to Google, my friends, because tonight belongs to Oscar.

 I want to thank the Academy, the Board of Governors. I want to thank Mr. Sid Ganis for flying my little golden friend over the ocean. And thank you, Sir Ben Kingsley, for presenting it to me. Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you deeply honored, mighty grateful, and just plain gobsmacked. Thank you.

2011,84,2011-11-12,"The Governors Awards (Grand Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Lawrence Gordon, John Travolta, Maria Shriver, Ayanna Hall",Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Oprah Winfrey,"OPRAH WINFREY:
 I didn't prepare a speech because I just wanted to feel whatever this is. Because Maria is so correct, it's very difficult for me to open myself to receive what people have to offer. And so tonight I came prepared to be open, and I would like to thank the Board of Governors for the opportunity to receive the love, and the Oscar.

 I never imagined myself receiving an Oscar, certainly not for doing what I believe is a part of my calling, is a part of my being. It's a part of why I am here. And what I know for sure is the only reason I am here is because Quincy Jones was in a hotel in Chicago in 1985, and was taking a shower, and was there for a lawsuit, that somebody was suing Michael Jackson saying that they were the girl of the song, or whatever. And he saw me on ""A.M. Chicago"" and said, ""I think that's Sofia."" So I would like to thank Quincy Jones, who is in Dubai right now.

 But Quincy Jones was a part of a divine manifestation for me. Those of you, anybody here who's ever watched ""The Oprah Show"" has heard me tell the story of how I first watched, first read The New York Times review on a Sunday about ""The Color Purple."" I read the review, because the book review is the first thing I ever look at on The New York Times. And Stedman and I to this day, it's like, ""You want the book review?"" I go, ""You read the front section. I'll read the book review first."" And I read the book review of ""The Color Purple."" And was in my pajamas, put on my coat, in Baltimore, and went to the bookstore and got the book. And from that moment became, literally, drawn to, in some kind of mystical way, to that story. Mainly because the character... The first line of the book is, ""Dear God, I'm fourteen years old..."" And I had lived that life and couldn't imagine that someone was able to put into words what I had already experienced.

 And so began this journey that I was able to really understand that God's hand, or power greater than myself, ""the forces,"" as Sidney Poitier calls them, were engaged in leading my life to a plane and a level that I had not even imagined. But I released myself to those forces, and literally said inside myself, ""Thy will be done."" And as a part of that journey, to be here tonight... Maria touched on it but it is really -- Stedman and I talk about this all the time. It's unimaginable if you are not a black, former colored girl, born in Mississippi in 1954, it's impossible for you to even know what this journey has meant. I know Larry Gordon, Mississippi Jew [laughs], almost as rare as I am [laughs], can begin to understand what that means, to be born in 1954 in Mississippi.

 When I saw ""The Help,"" and first heard that there was gonna be a movie called ""The Help,"" and first read the book, ""The Help,"" I thought that is my story. My grandmother was a maid. Her mother was a maid. The mother before her was a slave. My mother was a maid. My grandmother's greatest dream for me was that I would grow up in a family and have a career where... She used to say, ""I hope you get some good white folks. I hope you get some good white folks like I have. I have good white folks."" And the only picture I have of my grandmother is of her holding a white child in her maid's uniform. So, the journey from Kosciusko, Mississippi, where nobody ever even imagined it possible that you could be anything other than a maid who had some good white folks, who would give you clothes and would let you take food home on the holidays. It's unimaginable that I would be standing before you, voted by the Board of Governors... It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It is unimaginable! And so when I say thank you, the thank you comes from a place deeper than even I know, Sharon [Stone]. Even deeper than I know. Because it's not just from me, it's from everybody who made me possible. It's from every shoulder I ever stood on, every bridge I ever crossed, every story that's ever told, every story that ever imagined this day to be possible.

 I thank you for this award. And I will... What this means for me is, I woke up this morning, I said, ""What is Oscar? What is a... Oscar...?"" You know, I grew up wanting to be an actress and my father, being a barber and coming from the culture that he came from, said, ""No daughter of mine's going to be laying on some casting couch."" That was his idea of what being an actress meant. And so when the opportunity showed itself to me, to be a part of ""The Color Purple,"" it really is, was divine intervention, just to be a part of being able to share that story. I knew that something special, magical, a door had opened to me. And after that door came ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" and many other doors. But a door opened to me through the magic and majesty of film. The ability to tell stories in such a way that you connect to the heart-space of people, and you connect to the place where people really live, and not just live but where their souls abide, that is what great films do. And to this day, ""The Color Purple"" experience is one of the greatest experiences of my life.

 And yes, I'd like to do more films, but to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award means more to me than any film, any acclaim, even an Oscar. Because what it says is that you all get it. The Board of Governors, you get it. You get that what I've been trying to do and what I've been trying to say all these years is that every single person, Ayanna, and all of you and every person I've spoken to in over fifty thousand interviews of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" every single person who incarnates here to the planet matters. Your life matters. You matter. What you do matters. The fact that you are here, that you are born, that your presence here on earth means something. That's what I've been trying to say through all of my work, be it film, be it ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" be it the magazine, it is that we all matter. And what I really, really, really, really know for sure, is that this award to me represents all of you, sitting in a room -- I don't know how this happens. The governors, I don't know who you are. But when I got the call from Tom [Sherak] I was literally on a hike in Hawaii, and I get the call. The Academy has called! Security comes for me and says, ""You must come down from the mountain now! Stop the hike because Tom from the Academy is on the phone."" And then Larry Gordon is saying, ""Answer the phone! Answer the phone!"" And I'm like, whaaat...? Okay! What this really means is that you all understand that what I've been trying to do and what I've tried to say all these years, is that all us can make a difference through the life that we live.

 And when you understand, as I do, that this to me, I'm gonna allow this Oscar... Like I've interviewed everybody over the years and say, ""Where do you keep your Oscar?"" And people are always so nonchalant about it and they say: ""Oh my, I keep it in my bathroom."" ""I don't know where mine is."" ""My sister has it."" Well my new sister, my sister who I just discovered last year, this time last year, is here. Pat is here. I will say she will not have it; I will have it! And it will be on, I will keep it on my desk in front of me to remind me that you have voted for me. You have voted for what I believe is the essence of why we're all here. We're all here to help each other. We're all here to use our lives in service to one another. And nobody who has ever, ever done any kind of work... I mean I run a girls school and those girls are gonna be graduating from college. The first in their families to ever graduate from college. The first in their families to ever graduate high school. And those girls are coming to the United States and they're going to Wellesley and they're going to Brown and they're going to Tufts and they're going to all the great universities. And I will tell you that anybody who's ever done that, done any kind of work where you are hands on, where you're up on the phone and you're on at four o'clock in the morning and two in the morning and whatever, you're not doing that because you think you're gonna get an Oscar one day. You're doing it because you believe in the power of every human being who has come to this planet. And you know that these are all bodies, but inside the bodies there's a soul and a spirit and a power greater than we know. And for me this Oscar will represent love from all of you. I thank you for your vote of love and I will use it to increase the open space in my heart to continue to do the great and good work that we've all come to do and serve. Thank you so much.

2012,85,2013-02-24,Dolby Theatre,Meryl Streep,Actor in a Leading Role,NA,Lincoln,NA,Daniel Day-Lewis,"DANIEL DAY-LEWIS:
 I really don't know how any of this happened. I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that ""Lincoln"" shouldn't be a musical.

 My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago – or since we got married sixteen years ago – my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men. I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she's the versatile one in the family and she's been the perfect companion to all of them. I'd like to thank Kathy Kennedy, our producer, and through you, Kathy... and through you, our mighty team of co-conspirators. At the apex of that human pyramid there are three men to whom I owe this and a great deal more: Tony Kushner; our beloved skipper Steven Spielberg; and the mysteriously beautiful mind, body and spirit of Abraham Lincoln. For my mother. Thank you so much.

There are literally thousands of people to thank, so thankfully I'm not gonna thank them now. I'm going to thank everybody personally in the next few weeks, but there are a couple of people I want to acknowledge. I want to acknowledge my partner in crime and my great friend, George Clooney, who... Everybody should be so lucky to have a partner who is as talented and as humorous and who has as much integrity. So, thank you, George. I want to thank my beautiful wife Lysa; you make everything better. And to our kids, Maya and Olivia, I love you guys. I hope your old man's not embarrassing you up here. The reason I wanted to speak first – I wanted to speak before Ben – was Ben is a producer on the film and he is also our director. And I thought it would be awkward for Ben to thank himself, but it's not awkward for me. So on behalf of George and myself, I want to thank you, Ben. You directed a hell of a film. Couldn't be more proud of the film; couldn't be more proud of Ben. So ladies and gentlemen, our co-producer and the director of ""Argo"": Ben Affleck.

 Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. I know eventually that thing is gonna start to go, so forgive me if this is a little bit quick. I want to acknowledge Steven Spielberg, who I feel is a genius and a towering talent among us. I want to acknowledge the other eight films. There are eight great films that have every right, as much a right to be up here as we do. I want to acknowledge them and thank them for what they did, and for many of them who didn't even get nominated this year.

 I want to thank, you know, I mean, Jack McNiece*, and Jerry Speck*, and Marty Brest, and my brother, and my mom and dad, and Patrick Whitesell, and Tony Mendez, who let us do his story. Thank you. And I'm gonna forget – I thank everyone in the movie, on the movie, worked on the movie, did anything with this movie, gets thanked. I want to thank Canada. I want to thank our friends in Iran living in terrible circumstances right now. I want to thank my wife – who I don't normally associate with Iran, but... I want to thank you for working on our marriage for ten Christmases. It's good. It is work but it's the best kind of work, and there's no one I'd rather work with.

 And I just want to say, you know, I was here fifteen years ago or something, and, you know, I had no idea what I was doing. I stood out here in front of you all, really just a kid, and I went out, you know, and I never thought that I would be back here. And I am because of so many of you who are here tonight, because of this Academy, because of so many wonderful people who extended themselves to me when they had nothing to benefit from it in Hollywood. You know what I mean? I couldn't get 'em a job. I want to thank them and I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think you possibly can. You can't hold grudges. It's hard but you can't hold grudges. And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, because that's gonna happen. All that matters is that you gotta get up.

 Ah man. When I found out I was gonna receive this award they said, who do want to speak on your behalf. The first name out of my mouth, Al Ruddy. And I knew it. Because he's got more funny stories – but when you're a director that's not all good, because he's got the damn cast over here telling 'em stories and I'm waiting on him. I'd say, Ruddy, let 'em up. He'd let 'em up, they'd come over. Once I cut, they'd be back over listening to Ruddy. [To Ruddy next to him on stage:] Are you gonna stand here and listen to me or are you gonna sit down?

 Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You know something? You're looking at the luckiest man alive. And lucky to be alive. As a kid folks didn't think too much of me, of what I was gonna amount to. The reason, I was a sharecropper's son, way back in the hills of Arkansas during the Great Depression. With eight years of education. But for sure, for sure, my mom is looking down on tonight with a big smile on her face – sorry. By 1954, I'd served three years in the military as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division where I made over four hundred jumps. Most of those jumps were made testing parachutes. And on a lot of weekends I worked an aerial thrill show, which is perfect training for my first movie, ""The Spirit of St. Louis,"" that starred Jimmy Stewart. They were prepared to shoot a barnstorming sequence, all they needed was two guys to work on top of and underneath a couple of biplanes. The production manager was talking to my partner and I about how much we're going to charge them for the first stunt. Hell, I didn't know. I'd never done it before. I had no idea what'd be appropriate. But trying to get as much as I could I said, two thousand dollars every time we do it. A voice behind me said, ""For two thousand dollars I'll do it."" I looked around, it was the director, Billy Wilder. He walked past us, went down to the planes, climbed up on the top wing, buckled in. I said, this fool's got to be kidding. But he wasn't. He motioned the pilot to wind it up and took off. They bounced down across the field, made a couple of low passes and landed. When Billy Wilder climbed down off of that plane he says – he had a twinkle in his eye and a little smile on his face – and he said, ""Now how much do you want?"" We agreed that a thousand dollars would be just right. I worked six weeks on ""Spirit"" when they paid me more money than this cotton-pickin' kid had seen in his life. I now had a decision, a goal. I was gonna be a Hollywood stuntman.

 When I got into the business the stunt equipment was, adequate. I know, because I broke fifty-six bones, my back twice, punctured a lung, had a shoulder replaced and knocked out a few teeth trying to use that stuff. But never believing that and the fact that that's the way it's always done, I came up with a few pieces of equipment that made the stunts more real, more active and a lot, lot easier. Safer. And that's really what I was looking for. A way to save myself some trips to the hospital.

 You know, I didn't get here by myself; I had a lot of help. A lot of help. And I need to thank some of those folks. Like all the stuntmen and women who worked with me and for me, and made me look like I knew what I was doing. All the producers, directors, and stars that requested me. The Academy Board of Governors, for deciding to give me this award, this great award. And my wife Ellyn, for putting up with me for all these years, nursing me back to health many times, but best of all, the neverending love. Honey, you're the best; thank you. One last thing. I want to thank the entire Hollywood community for allowing me to be part of it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

 I'm gonna put some notes out here, but hopefully I won't get lost in them. [Looking at the Oscar:] Kind of amazing. I mean I... Everybody here probably has one of these already, right? I'm the last one to get it. Alright, well, I want to thank Hawk Koch who called me up – I thought it was early in the morning but Chris says it was late at night – and told me he was from the Academy and that they were gonna give me one of these. And I did say, are you kidding? It seems, you know, New York is a long way from here. And people in New York who make films never expect to even go to Oscarland, much less get one. So it's kind of a... I mean, and there's also the distance between the 16mm film and the 35mm, and the 40mm, and the 70mm, and whatever. So it's a long stretch, and being here now, I'm kinda trying to deal with it. It's hard.

 Anyway, I have to thank the Board of Governors who made this possible. And I want to thank – well I want to congratulate Jeffrey Katzenberg, whom I just met. Actually we almost met in New York at a screening, but not quite. He was a few rows ahead of me and we were all getting out. Hal Needham, whom I don't know. And George Stevens whom I know from long ago when I was on an NEA panel. And I think he was getting some funding from that panel, so we got to go for two or three days out here, and he arranged a really nice thing with starlets and... It was interesting. It was great. I liked him for that. And then I... And Michael Moore, who probably is responsible for everything that's happening here tonight, as far as I can see, but whom, you know... I mean I, Michael's amazing. He's like Chaplin. He's created a kind of... The minute you see the hat and his head you know exactly what's gonna happen. That's fantastic. You know, very few people can do that. I think that's called branding. Anyway he, just knowing that Michael's on the case I sleep better, that's all I can tell you. And I love him. He's just, well, he's a man who is passionate about seeing fairness take place, and that's a hard thing in our time.

 Anyway. And Bobby Neuwirth, who's somewhere here. He was Dylan's road manager. And I met him with Bobby down at this bar in the Village. That was when Dylan'd say I have an idea for doing a film whereby I'll take some pieces of cardboard and we'll write things on, I'll write words from a song on 'em, and I'll throw them down. Is that a good idea? And I said, it's a fantastic idea. So we brought about a thousand shirt cardboards with us to England when we made the film there. And the thing Neuwirth was, from the very beginning, and this is always amazing. It's like meeting your, the woman you're gonna marry or the child that you want to raise. He knew somehow instinctively exactly what I was gonna do. And he often made it happen; he made it possible. He didn't arrange anything or direct anything, but he was willing whatever we needed to happen. And that was the first time I'd ever run across that. Actually, it was the first time I'd made a movie about a person with dialog, so there were a lot of new things going on there for me.

 Anyway, the person that I have to thank the hardest is the love of my life, Chris, whom when I first met her, she was looking for a job. She said – but later I think, I decided she was really looking to get her hands on my camera, which I thought was reasonable. And I right away could see that she could be the partner that I really always was looking for. The person who had the same, was driven by the same passion for a certain kind of film that I was. And that's thirty-six years ago, and we haven't changed... Although when we make a film – yeah, give her a hand. She's so beautiful; she spent two hours getting made up tonight and she looks fantastic. Anyway, she and I have made a lot of films together. We made, of course, ""The War Room"" with Nick Doob, who I think is here. And when we make films, when you, shooting them you're great friends. Because there's nothing but problems to be solved, so you're pals. And then you sit down at either the Steenbeck, or whatever editing machine there is, and it all begins. You get divorced about four times a week. But you know, it's a process. Even though you're practically choking each other to death over each editing decision, there's nothing in the world I love better than doing that with her. It's just my favorite thing. So even if I had nothing else to do, that would be the thing I would choose that would be the best fun. So anyway, that's, she knows all about this because I tell her all the time.

 And we also... Al and Chris together made the film with Al Franken, with Nick Doob and Al Franken. And that was the – well I tell ya, I was really surprised when Al came up and introduced me there. That was... he's such a... Well that's an interesting film. I mean, I don't know if any of you've seen it. I mean, I've seen it a lot of times, but... I was, for that film I was the producer. And any of you who make documentary film know the role of the producer. I might as well have stayed home; I don't do very much. But they made a fantastic film. And I think that when, you know, the thing about it was that here was a guy who was invited to parties because he'd make everybody laugh. He was kind of a party clown and he had been an originator of SNL, so he was really very good at it. You know, he, but he was also a person who could see when things were going wrong, and he could see who the problems were and who was doing it. And so in the course of that film – and boy, it's very seldom you make a film about somebody and see them change, really change their lives. That's like magic happening. And he decided he was gonna run for the Senate. And it's, and there was this story he told which was, it wasn't really a dirty story but it had kind of dirty implications you would say. I mean you wouldn't want your five-year-old to tell it in school. And he used to tell it at big gatherings like this and everybody would laugh and laugh. And somebody said to him, ""You're running for Senate now, you can't tell that story."" And he said ""What! I can't tell that story? What's wrong with that story?"" ""Can't do it."" ""Okay,"" he said. ""I won't tell that story."" And that was the end of the film. But you know it was such an amazing thing – I hear him laughing out there. It was such an amazing thing because he would do anything. He saw that being a Senator was so much more important than anything he'd ever done before that he was ready to even not tell that story. And I thought that was a show of character that I really loved.

 Anyhow. Beyond that I think, we made a film with Roger Friedman. It was called the, ""Only the Strong Survive."" It was sort of an interesting thing, because Roger is a New York Jew. And to all the musicians in Memphis, he was the enemy, right? The New York Jew came out and stole their music and never gave them any money back. And when Roger arrived in Memphis, we thought, well, we'll have a little problem. They loved Roger! Because he's seen, he knew every song they ever sang and he'd been at every concert they'd ever seen. They, the people were not very interested in us because they didn't know who we were. We were just two filmmakers from New York. But seeing Roger in that atmosphere and to follow him from the kind of talent that Stax and all those various music originators came up with was, well it was very exciting for me. It was the kind of music I didn't know much about. And at the end of that film I really felt like I'd been through some kind of a college course in something or other. And Roger did it. We just followed Roger. We didn't know what to look at or who to listen to, and he took us to those places. So I'm very grateful to what he was able to do. And still, you know, for my birthday party he said, ""I got a surprise for you. Aretha Franklin is coming to your party."" And she did. We sat down; I talked for a half an hour to Aretha Franklin. And I'll never get over that; that was my birthday present from Roger.

 Well anyway. And then I have to thank my family. A horde of people sitting at a table over there. And I think at least one grandchild and one on the way. Chelsea, she's about to whelp. And you know, that my family all, we, I tell you it's grown so, I think I have eight children and then I think I have thirteen or fourteen – I'm not sure which – grandchildren. So Thanksgivings are impossible. And this is the first time we've all been sitting together. It's kind of wonderful. It's a family reunion, and that's kind of nice. And then there's Frazer, my son [applause] – yeah, right. Who by some magic of DNN, DNA – whatever it is – has managed to be older than I am. So he's our boss and runs our company, and has, which he's done successfully for thirty-five years or so. For us success is, you know, not cashing huge amounts of money at the bank but being able to make the next film. Because it takes us a little longer to make a film than maybe we should. You know, we have to argue and fight over it, and that, you know, it's always difficult. And he's made that so that happens. You know, even if he wasn't my son I would have to be very grateful and loving to him because that's an amazing thing to do. That's an act of love.

 And then there's people that I've worked with. Jim Desmond who, with Nick Proferes, two people who had kind of, were neophytes in our organization. They'd just come to work with us to find out how these films were made. And when we were at Monterey, I thought, Ravi Shankar? Who's Ravi Shankar? You know, nobody here is gonna be interested in this music. So I said, you guys can go film Ravi Shankar music and all the rest of us heavy filmmakers will film the people in the audience. The L.A. factions and the San Francisco factions were sort of making peace but also heavily at war. And halfway through that thing that they did, which was a fantastic piece of music, I began... Everybody was really intent on listening and I could hear that it was kinda more than I thought it was gonna be, so I said, I'd better go down and see how those guys are doing. And I went down in the front and there the two of them were just gunning it. They were so, I was thrilled just watching them film. And I didn't even know what they were getting, but I could see that they were really into it. So I was able to film the audience. I didn't even bother to do anything. And that's, when I looked at the rushes I saw that that film that they had shot was the, was gonna be the ending of the film. It was the most exciting thing that we'd done there. And the thing that was amazing, and I tell students to watch that sequence and you'll see two people learning how to be filmmakers in less than an hour. And it's an amazing thing to watch because they, in the beginning they weren't sure what to shoot. And by the end they were just so right on it that it's hair-raising. And that was those, that was Nick and Jim Desmond.

 And then I think the one person that was very instrumental in my education as a filmmaker was Bobby Neuwirth. And he sort of knew how to function in a group of people without disturbing them, and yet watching what they really did, not what they pretended to do. And that was something that I needed to learn because I had never really filmed a number – most of my films were like ""Daybreak Express."" I just got Duke Ellington music, and you can't, you know, what can you do worse than that?

 And then I think later that we worked with Joan Churchill and Alan Barker, and we did a film ""Searching for Jimi Hendrix."" And it was so marvelous to have somebody that I knew on the other coast so we didn't have to – we had no budget for it so we couldn't come flying out here to do something. And Joan and Alan, what they did was just as good as anything we could have done. So it taught me that people were learning and getting as good as they needed to and that was a very exciting possibility. And then one day R.J. Cutler and Wendy Ettinger came to visit us, and neither of them had ever made a film – am I going too long, do you think? I don't want to overwhelm this thing here. But, alright, well anyway. They had never made a film and they said why aren't you making a film about this election. And we said, what election? You know. And so they really knew – well, I'm getting mixed signals from my family here. And they said... we said, well we don't have any money and we don't know anybody there. And at this point I think Clinton was in fourth place in New York. So even though my enthusiasm was for Clinton I didn't see how I could make that into a film. And they said, we'll get you a little money, which they did. And we'll find out, we'll call up and get you some people to let you in. And they did that and we made ""The War Room"" with them. And that was sort of a marvelous thing. You're saying... Oh, alright.

 So anyway, I want to say I'm really grateful for this amazing award. And what it tells me, or what I get from it is that, as kind of a foreigner from New York who all my life, you know, everything I learned about films was in watching the movies that you people out here made. I mean, that's my education in film. And that watching those films and thinking about this award has made me feel that finally, between here and New York, there's finally some kind of a bridge. And that you guys all somehow now consider us fellow filmmakers. And that's wonderful. Thank you.

 Thank you so much. And thank you, dear Sidney, and wonderful Annette. Sitting out here with all of you enjoying this wonderful evening, it made me think back to the first time I saw one of these. It was a long time ago. It was in, it was on March 15, 1944. I was eleven years old. My father was away at war, preparing for D-Day. He'd been nominated for directing for a movie called ""The More the Merrier."" And I was planning on going to a twi-night double-header between the Hollywood Stars and the San Francisco Seals down at Gilmore Field over there on Beverly. And my mother told me that instead we were going to Grauman's Chinese and that if my father won this award I was going to accept it. I remember putting on an itchy suit and going to the Chinese with my mother and my grandmother. And my mother saying that, how gracious the stars sitting around us were – Jean Arthur, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman – when the other's picture would win for art direction or sound, and they would applaud, and it was so nice. And then a fine director of the day, Mark Sandrich, came on the stage to present the award for best director. And I was ready. But you should understand this. I knew the batting averages of every player in the Hollywood Stars' lineup, but I had never heard of ""Casablanca."" Mark Sandrich read the names, opened the envelope, and he said: Michael Curtiz, ""Casablanca."" And unlike the gracious ladies sitting around me – my mother said that I had a deep and rather resonant voice for a boy my age – I said, ""We wuz robbed!""

 Well you see, I mean, I didn't grow up to come here. I wanted to be a sportswriter. My heroes were Grantland Rice and Red Smith. And maybe it was partly a little thing of self-preservation, that I didn't want to devote my life to becoming the second-best film director in my family. But, it a... you know, I had this legacy. My grandmother, Georgia Woodthorpe, was the great actress of the age in San Francisco. She played ""Ophelia"" to Edwin Booth's ""Hamlet."" And her daughter, Georgie Cooper, married Landers Stevens. They were both actor and actress matinee idols in San Francisco, and Landers was a director. And when the movies ruined the theater they moved to Hollywood. The next time you see ""Swing Time,"" that handsome, grey-haired man who plays the father of the girl that Fred Astaire stands up at her wedding, that's Landers Stevens. And my other grandmother, Alice Howell, she came here and starred in the first six films that Charlie Chaplin made and went on to make a hundred more. And my mother, she was a Mack Sennett bathing beauty until she retired to raise me. So, it's sort of in our blood. And my daughter Caroline is here; she's a documentary filmmaker. My son Michael is a writer-producer-director. He's in Washington tonight, producing the Kennedy Center Honors. Probably making me irrelevant. And so they are fifth generation in show business. Which makes Liz and me especially proud of our son David, with his doctoral degree from Harvard and his company called Symphony Learning, he is teaching children to learn. And at long last he has proven that a Stevens can make a living in the real world. David.

 I went back to the Oscars years later, this time with my father, and I sat next to him the night he won for ""A Place in the Sun."" And riding home that night, he was driving the car – it was different in those days – and the Oscar was on the seat between us. And I was pretty excited. And I think he thought I was a little too excited. He leaned over, smiled, and he said something that shaped my life. He said, we'll have a better idea what kind of a film this is in about twenty-five years. He was talking about the test of time. And it was the test of time that was the underlying idea and the ethic of the American Film Institute and later the Kennedy Center Honors. So I thank Dad for that and for opening the door for me to a creative life that has been so rich and gifted me with so many wonderful friends in our profession. And the test of time, I've seen a couple of pictures this fall that I am confident will stand the test of time. And I think it is so important that there are filmmakers among us who will swim into the currents, who will challenge the industrialization of moviemaking to make films that are filled with passion and glory and pity and sacrifice, and reached to the depths of our humanity. And so thinking of that I thank the Academy, I thank the Board of Governors. And this means a great deal to me because of our shared values about the importance and the value of film. So tonight I say, here's to the great films of the future. And I should add, tonight I wasn't robbed. Thanks so much.

2012,85,2012-12-01,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Will Smith, Ruthie Tompson, Tom Hanks",Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Jeffrey Katzenberg,"JEFFREY KATZENBERG:
 Thank you. Thank you first to the Academy and the Board. This is a truly great honor. And I have to thank both Tom and Will. To receive this award from two of our greatest talents and two people I am lucky to be able to call my friends is a distinct honor of its own, as it is to be here among movie legends Mr. Pennebaker, George Stevens and Hal Needham.

 My story is of mentors. People who give of their time and their talents, of their words and their wisdom. People who encourage all of us to reach for more and in doing so inspire us. Inspire us to strive for exellence not only in ourselves but in each other. My first mentors, my parents, they gave me life and they gave me a deep appreciation for what it is to give to others. There are days between my second and third breakfasts when I think how lucky I was to have been mentored at such an early age. My mom, she passed away a little over a month ago, and I really regret that I never told her this enough. But my father is here tonight and, Dad, I want to say now just how much you mean to me and how much I love and appreciate you for all you have given to me.

 Mentors. John Lindsay, the late, great mayor of New York, taught me the power of believing. Believing in an ideal. For when he looked out across a sea of problems and people in need, most of whom asked for nothing, said he wanted to try and make their world just a little bit better. And he did. This was an early lesson and a simple truth that each of us can and should make a difference.

 Kirk Douglas. I met Kirk, as most of the world did, larger than life on a giant silver screen. Spartacus, a true hero. Then I had the honor of meeting him in real life and he was an even larger hero in person. It's Kirk who taught me you haven't learned to live until you've learned to give. It's a statement that echoes loudly and it is in many ways the mantra of Hollywood. Think of George Clooney and the Sudan. Think of Steven Spielberg and Shoah. Think of Angelina Jolie and the United Nations. Think of David Geffen, well, everything. The list is long and I am honored to be among the many.

 In fact, standing here alone doesn't feel quite right to me. It projects a bit of a false image. Because mostly all I did was pick up the phone and ask you. It's you who did it. You who give of your time, your talent, your money, your hearts. Because that's what you do, that is what Hollywood does. And I know what it is to be asked. I was asked by Lew and Edie Wasserman, mentors. They asked me to take a moment to consider the Motion Picture Television Fund, and the ask was all that it took. A place to care for many of our nation's great artists and storytellers, a place for mentors to be safe and to be appreciated. You saw their faces, heard their voices in that video, and there is so much more. I stand here tonight on their behalf with particular pride because this award bears the name of Jean Hersholt. It was he nearly seventy-five years ago who was among the founders of the Motion Picture Relief Fund. I'm tempted to say it's the circle of life, but a circle implies something complete and we at the Fund have a greater horizon.

 I will end with my thanks to the person who is every single day my greatest mentor. We met back in the John Lindsay days and we are here today as partners in giving and partners in living. The mother of my amazing children, she is my wife, and she is my life. Marilyn. And to all of you, I want to thank you again for giving so generously of your time, of your talent and of your hearts. You might say that all of us who work in the film industry, we actually live in two worlds. There's the imaginary world we project on the screen and then there's the real world that we live in every day. All of the other Oscars, they pay tribute to the talent that goes into the creation of those imaginary worlds. I believe this particular Hersholt Award is a recognition of the extraordinary generosity of our industry towards improving the real world that we all share. And it is with that in mind and, I think, really on your behalf that I humbly and proudly accept this amazing recognition. Thank you so very much.

2013,86,2014-03-02,Dolby Theatre,Jennifer Lawrence,Actor in a Leading Role,NA,Dallas Buyers Club,NA,Matthew McConaughey,"MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY:
 Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.

 There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, ""When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.""

 To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.

 And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, ""Who's your hero?"" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, ""Who's your hero?"" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, ""So, are you a hero?"" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, ""Why?"" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.

 So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you.

 Incredible. Ellen, I love you. To my fellow nominees, I'm so proud to share this journey with you. I'm in awe and have so much respect for you all. To the Academy, thank you.

 In 1971, Bossier City, Louisiana, there was a teenage girl who was pregnant with her second child. She was a high school dropout and a single mom, but somehow she managed to make a better life for herself and her children. She encouraged her kids to be creative, to work hard and to do something special. That girl is my mother, and she's here tonight. And I just want to say, I love you, Mom. Thank you for teaching me to dream. To my brother, Shannon, the best big brother in the world, you're a true artist. Thank you so much for sharing this insane and amazing adventure that is Thirty Seconds to Mars, and for being my best friend. I love you. Thank you.

 To all the dreamers out there around the world watching this tonight in places like the Ukraine and Venezuela, I want to say, we are here. And as you struggle to, to make your dreams happen, to live the impossible, we're thinking of you tonight. And this is incredibly special as well, because there's so many people that helped me get here. And I just want to say thank you to Focus Features, to Mick Sullivan, to Jim Toth, to Jason Weinberg, to Emma Ludbrook, to Callie Addams, to the entire ""Dallas Buyers Club"" team. Matthew, I love you. Jean-Marc.

 And this is for the 36 million people who have lost the battle to AIDS. And to those of you out there who have ever felt injustice because of who you are or who you love, tonight I stand here in front of the world with you and for you. Thank you so much and goodnight.

2013,86,2014-03-02,Dolby Theatre,Daniel Day-Lewis,Actress in a Leading Role,NA,Blue Jasmine,NA,Cate Blanchett,"CATE BLANCHETT:
 Sit down; you're too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis. From you it exacerbates this honor to it and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary – yet again – extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in ""American Hustle"" blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.

 And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that ""Blue Jasmine"" stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!

 Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of ""Blue Jasmine,"" I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in ""Blue Jasmine,"" I thank you so much.

 And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on ""Blue Jasmine,"" it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia, and Michael Wilkinson and CM and I are just tonight's tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you.

 Thank you. Thank you so much. It's quite overwhelming. Thank you to the members of the Academy for this honor; my dear friends, who are here tonight; Gena and George, for your kind words. To my hero, Louis Zamperini. The cast of ""Blood and Honey."" And most of all to my family. My love, your support and your guidance make everything that I do possible. Madd – I'm not going to cry, I promise. [Laughs] I won't embarrass you. You and your brothers and sisters are my happiness, and there's no greater honor in this world than being your mom.

 I'm very humbled to be here tonight among so many extraordinary artists. My mother loved art. She loved film. She supported any crazy thing I did, but whenever it had meaning she made a point of telling me that is what film is for. And she never had a career as an artist. She never had the opportunity to express herself beyond her theater class. But she wanted more than for herself, she wanted for Jamie and I to know what it is to have a life as artists, and she gave us that chance. She drove me to every audition and she would wait in the car for hours. Always make me feel really good all the times I didn't get the job, and when I did we would jump up and down and scream and yell like little girls. She wasn't really the best critic since she never had anything unkind to say, but she did give me love and confidence and, above all, she was very clear that nothing would mean anything if I didn't live a life of use to others.

 And I didn't know what that meant for a long time. I came into this business young and worried about my own experiences and my own pain, and it was only when I began to travel and look and live beyond my home, did I understand my responsibility to others. And when I met survivors of war and famine and rape, I learned what life is like for most people in this world and how fortunate I was to have food to eat, a roof over my head, a safe place to live, and the joy of having my family safe and healthy. And I realized how sheltered I had been and I was determined never to be that way again.

 We are all, everyone in this room, so fortunate. I have never understood why some people are lucky enough to be born with the chance that I had, to have this path in life, and why across the world there's a woman just like me, with the same abilities and the same desires, the same work ethic and love for her family, who would most likely make better films and better speeches, only she sits in a refugee camp and she has no voice. She worries about what her children will eat, how to keep them safe, and if they'll ever be allowed to return home. I don't know why this is my life and that's hers. I don't understand that. But I will do as my mother asked, and I will do the best I can with this life to be of use. And to stand here today means that I did as she asked, and if she were alive she'd be very proud. So thank you for that.

 Oh, you have no idea. Oh my God. Oh, this is so marvelous. Thank you. Oh, this is amazing; what an incredible moment. Gosh. What an eleven o'clock number! Oh wow.

 You know, when I was first asked by the Academy who I would like to introduce me, I thought carefully and I came to a conclusion that the one person who really knew about my early work was Robert, Robert Osborne. I mean, so many of the legendary directors and producers who gave me such incredible opportunities in film, they were long gone, you know. I was still around. But thanks to Turner Classic Movies and Robert those great films are shown and studied and discussed by students everywhere, as well as seen by a huge general audience. So, thank you, TMC, and thank you, Robert, for keeping me alive all these years. [Laughs]

 Emma, bless your heart. ""Aunt Adelaide"" was a wonderful moment for me because I had sort of pulled out completely of everything when my darling husband Peter died. And you, by inviting me to play the dreaded ""Aunt Adelaide,"" you simply helped me get back on track. And I am incredibly indebted to you for that.

 You know, during the long course of my career in film and television and theater I have known and worked with the very best of their time. You know, Ingrid Bergman, that beautiful, lovely woman. Bette Davis, crazy, wonderful dame. Kate Hepburn, [makes a growling noise] you know...I give her credit, really, for getting me into the part...she really got me the part in ""State of the Union."" I don't think I ever would have got it without her help. And, you know, people like Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier and Frank Sinatra, Paul Newman and Spencer Tracy. James Earl Jones, who I just completed a six-month tour of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in Australia with; which was a fantastic experience. And I must tell you, I even had coffee in the MGM commissary with Clark Gable. That's as far as it went, you understand. But we were on the lot together. I once saw him driving down Sunset Blvd., I'll never forget, in a dark brown Mercedes convertible. I never got over it. And when I could afford it I got the same car in dark brown [laughs] and drove it for years until it was stolen.

 But how would I have even begun my career in ""Gaslight"" without the belief of the great directors of that time, in that case, of course, George Cukor. Or Arthur [sic] Lewin in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" Or been given the incredible role of ""Mrs. Iselin"" in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" by the great John Frankenheimer, whose widow is here with me tonight, bless her heart. And I'm so proud that she is. I just couldn't top that role, so I took off for Broadway and musical comedy by way of Stephen Sondheim's ""Anyone Can Whistle"" and Jerry Herman's ""Mame.""

 Now, movies have taken a bit of a back seat since then, except of course for darling ""Mrs. Potts"" and ""Eglantine Price."" But in 1984, I came back to Universal City and I stayed around for twelve years playing ""Jessica Fletcher"" in ""Murder, She Wrote."" The interesting thing is that ""Murder, She Wrote"" has given me more worldwide attention than any role I ever played in movies or on the stage [laughs]. And it's a wonderful thing to be known, you know, in Spain and Portugal and Paris and France and Germany and everywhere, and, you know, to have a whole kind of worldwide career. That's what television does for you if have a hit show, and we did.

 You know, you can't imagine how happy and proud, indeed I feel really undeserving of this gorgeous golden chap. And I want to thank the Governors' Honorary Oscar from the Academy tonight, and to be here in the company of my beloved family and friends instead of sitting, shivering with hope and then disappointment in Grauman's Chinese Theatre in the 1940s and 60s – yeah. Sharing this wonderful occasion with me tonight are my twin brothers Edgar and Bruce Lansbury, who traveled with me and our mother Moyna to this great country as evacuees from England in 1940. And my sons Anthony and David, and my darling daughter Deirdre, and my wonderful grandchildren Peter, Katherine and Ian. Let me tell ya, it doesn't get much better than that. Thank you.

2013,86,2013-11-16,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Bill Taylor, Martin Short, Tom Hanks",Honorary Award,in recognition of his extraordinary talents and the unique inspiration he has brought to the art of motion pictures.,NA,NA,Steve Martin,"STEVE MARTIN:
 Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. This is so nice, so nice of you. Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a longtime dream of mine that I would one day receive an Honorary Oscar, and tonight I feel I am one step closer to that dream. [Tom Hanks walks over to the podium to take a picture of himself with Martin.] Oh, cool. Hey! Thanks [laughs]. So now it's just, the class level has dropped completely. I can't possibly express how excited I am tonight, because the Botox is fresh. You know, it is said that the art and craft of filmmaking is collaborative, so to be singled out and rewarded tonight means that that is not true. [Looking around the room:] Is it my imagination or is this year's Oscar ceremony a little on the cheap side?

 I must thank the people who spoke on my behalf tonight. My high school friend Bill Taylor. Bill – by the way, he was a distinguished visual effects artist and cinematographer – whoever thought we would meet more than fifty years later on such an auspicious stage. Congratulations on your life and career too, Bill. And following Bill, a comedian so renowned and funny, whose work has only grown over the years and who never fails to make us laugh in new and unique ways; if only we had had someone like that tonight. You should have seen Marty Short's face fall when I told him the gift basket was taxable. And then the beautiful speech by Tom Hanks. Thank you, Tom. Everybody loves Tom Hanks. What a talent. Tom Hanks...Tom Hanks...I saw ""Captain Phillips."" I didn't think it was so funny.

 But seriously, I have so many people in my career to mention and thank. My very first manager back in the sixties, Bill McEuen. My first two agents, Marty Klein and John Gaines; some of you may remember them. John Gaines was all business. One time he called me and he said, ""Steve, two things. One: hello..."" Carl Reiner. How lucky was I to get with Carl Reiner, who taught me so much about how to work on a script. David Picker. Michael Gendler, my lawyer for over, I think it's thirty years is it, Michael? Something like that. I stick with people until they die. Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer. Nora Ephron. Frank Griffin, my makeup man for over – how many? Twenty years? More than that, more than that. Dan Melnick, a producer who had a great eye for a script. Fred Schepisi, who directed ""Roxanne."" John Hughes, who wrote and directed ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" I read the first script and it was, the first script was 165 pages long. I loved the script. I said to John, ""What are you thinking about cutting?"" And he said, ""Cutting?"" The first cut of the film was 4½ hours long.

 Phil Robinson, who's here tonight, and wrote ""All of Me,"" which absolutely changed my career. Brian Grazer, another producer who kept his eye on the script. Ron Howard. David Mamet. Larry Kasdan, the great Larry Kasdan. Frank Oz, who's here tonight, who did so much great comedies, some of my best comedies with him. Mick Jackson, who directed ""L.A. Story."" John Landis, who directed the little movie that could, the ""¡Three Amigos!."" Bob Simonds. Ed Limato, God rest his soul. Adam Venit. So many of my agents have died; watch out, Adam. My wife Anne Stringfield, who is as beautiful as she is smart. And...hey [begins to tear up]. I knew I wasn't going to make it through this speech. I read it to my dog this morning and wept. My wife alone would have been enough reward for my life but now she has brought me a wonderful child. And for some mysterious reason she really loves that child. I don't know; I don't get it.

 In 2008, Nancy Meyers asked me to appear in ""It's Complicated"" with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. And I hadn't done a movie in a long while and I didn't really know how I felt about them anymore. Because along with the joy that they had brought me over the past thirty-four years, people in this room know they also bring an equal amount of artistic heartache. And I went out to the set, across the Queensboro Bridge, on that cold winter morning. And on the first day of shooting I opened the door to the dark soundstage, and I stepped over all those black snaking electric cables, and walked past the craft service table that overflowed with boxes of raisins and bagels and muffins, and the slowest toaster in the world, and jars of M&M's and Twizzlers for breakfast, and every variety of mustard. And as I made this little journey that I had made a thousand times at every studio in this city, walking through the corridors, through this flimsy plywood flats, and the light changing from pitch black to blinding white, I thought: Home. So to get an award for something that you realize has seeped into your bones and to understand tonight that the work over the decades has at least meant something to someone is especially satisfying.

 But working in the movies has also brought something, an amazing gift, that has accummulated through these decades of filmmaking that cannot be matched, something wonderful and magical and its impact on my life is profound. Friends – fascinating, funny, and lifelong. Many of them are here in this room tonight. So thank you, movies, and thank you, Academy, for this award and a glorious reminder of the true benefit that I have received.

 Well, Piero Tosi wishes he could be here tonight. He actually never traveled to the United States, a country he has above all known and loved through cinema. Piero is passionate about his work and therefore it is with great excitement that he received the news of this unexpected Honorary Award. An award for which he thank all of the Academy and which he accepts also thanks that through this recognition the Academy intended to bestow recognition to all those who work with behind the camera. Piero wishes to thank Deborah Landis for the dedication with which she change our work.

 Though Piero is not here, at his table are many colleagues and fellow companions with which he feels to share this recognition: Ann Roth; Milena Canonero; Gabriella Pescucci; Dino Trappetti, CEO of Tirelli Costume House; and Carlo Poggioli. But Piero asked me, an actress, to collect this prize because he believes that the work of a costume designer is mainly dedicated to us, the actors. I suspect that he choose me because he think he made me suffer a lot during the ten films we did together, even if he said something different. ""Dear Claudia, please go to pick up my prize. With you there will be 'Angelica' and 'Bianca,' 'The Leopard' and 'La viaccia,' Visconti and Bolognini, and all the Italian cinema to which I have devoted my entire career."" On behalf of Piero, thank you very much.

 Thank you so much. I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer. If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.

 I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did.

 First, I would like to thank God that lives in us all. Recently John and I got to go to Selma and perform ""Glory"" on the same bridge that Dr. King and the people of the civil rights movement marched on fifty years ago. This bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation but now is a symbol for change. The spirit of this bridge transcends race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and social status. The spirit of this bridge connects the kid from the South Side of Chicago dreaming of a better life, to those in France standing up for their freedom of expression, to the people in Hong Kong protesting for democracy. This bridge was built on hope, welded with compassion and elevated by love for all human beings.

 JOHN STEPHENS (John Legend):
 Thank you. Nina Simone said it's an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live. We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were fifty years ago, but we say that Selma is now because the struggle for justice is right now. We know that the Voting Rights Act that they fought for fifty years ago is being compromised right now in this country today. We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850. When people are marching with our song, we want to tell you we are with you, we see you, we love you, and march on. God bless you.

2014,87,2014-11-08,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Chris Rock, Susan Sarandon",Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Harry Belafonte,"HARRY BELAFONTE:
 I would like to start off by saying thank you to Susan Sarandon, not just for the anointing and the words she has just spoken but because she has been so much in the lives of people who need the human heart and the human spirit to be in the midst of their struggle to better themselves. And I'd like to thank Chris Rock for bringing humor into the moment. And I'd like to also thank all of you who are here this evening. My very good friends and very close friends, who have turned out to be in support. And all the rest of you whom I don't know intimately but have felt your presence in my life because I've seen your art, I've seen your work, I've seen your poetry and I have been inspired by much. So thank you for all this, and I will now get on with my remarks for this evening.

 America has come a long way since Hollywood in 1915 gave the world the film ""Birth of a Nation."" By all measure, this cinematic work was considered the greatest film ever made. The power of moving pictures to impact on human behavior was never more powerfully evidenced than when after the release of this film American citizens went on a murderous rampage. Races were set one against the other. Fire and violence erupted. Baseball bats and billy clubs bashed heads. Blood flowed in streets of our cities and lives were lost. The film also gained the distinction of being the first film ever screened at the White House. The then-presiding president, Woodrow Wilson, openly praised the film. And with the power of this presidential anointing validated the film's brutality and its grossly distorted view of history. This, too, further inflamed the nation's racial divide.

 In 1935, at the age of eight, sitting in a Harlem theater, I watched in awe and wonder the incredible feats of the white superhero, Tarzan of the Apes. Tarzan was a sight to see. This porcelain Adonis, this white liberator, who could speak no language, swinging from tree to tree, saving Africa from the tragedy of destruction by a black indigenous population of inept, ignorant, void-of-any-skills population governed by ancient superstitions with no heart for Christian charity. Through this film the virus of racial inferiority, of never wanting to be identified with anything African, swept into the psyche of its youthful observers. And for the years that followed Hollywood brought abundant opportunity for black children in their Harlem theaters to cheer Tarzan and boo Africans. Native Americans, our Indian brothers and sisters, fared no better. And at the moment, Arabs ain't lookin' so good.

 But these encounters set other things in motion. It was an early stimulus to the beginning of my rebellion. Rebellion against injustice and human distortion and hate. How fortunate for me that the performing arts became the catalyst that fueled my desire for social change. In its pursuit I came upon fellow artists, like the great actor – and my hero – singer-humanist Paul Robeson, painter Charles White, dancer Katherine Dunham. Historian's superior academic mind, Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois. Social strategist and educator Eleanor Roosevelt. Writers Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou and James Baldwin. They all inspired me. They excited me. Deeply influenced me. And they were also my moral compass. It was Robeson who said, as you heard in the film earlier, ""Artists are the gatekeepers of truth. They are civilization's radical voice."" This Robeson-environment sounded like a desired place to be and given the opportunity to dwell there has never disappointed me.

 For my life of activism and a commitment to social change, the opposition has been fiercely punitive. Some who have controlled institutions of culture and commentary have at times used their power to not only distort truth but to punish the truthseekers. With interventions like McCarthyism and the blacklist, Hollywood, too, has sadly played its part in these tragic scenarios and on occasion I have been one of its targets. However, from the cultural environment that gave us all this social drama, all those movies – ""Birth of a Nation,"" Tarzan of the Apes, ""Song of the South,"" to name but a few – today's cultural harvest yields a sweeter fruit. ""Defiant Ones,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""12 Years a Slave,"" and many more. And all of this happening at the dawning of technological creations that will give artists boundless regions of possibilities to give us deeper insights into human existence. How fortunate for me that I have lived long enough for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to have chosen to bestow this honor upon me.

 Tonight is no casual encounter for me. Along with the trophy of honor, there's another layer that gives this journey this kind of wonderful Hollywood ending. To be rewarded by my peers for my work in human rights, and civil rights, and for peace, well, let me put it this way. It powerfully mutes the enemy's thunder. Approaching eighty-eight years of age, how truly poetic that as I joyfully glow with my fellow honorees we should have in our midst as one of our celebrators a man who did so much in his own life to redirect the ship of racial hatred in American culture. His efforts made the journey a bit easier. Ladies and gentlemen, I refer to my friend – my elderly friend – Sidney Poitier. [Poitier joins him onstage.]

 I thank the Academy and its Board of Governors for this honor, for this recognition. I really wish I could be around for the rest of this century to see what Hollywood does with the rest of the century. Maybe, just maybe, it could be civilization's game changer. After all, Paul Robeson said, ""Artists are the radical voice of civilization."" Each and every one of you in this room with your gifts, and your power, and your skills, could perhaps change the way in which our global humanity mistrusts itself. Perhaps we as artists and as visionaries for what's better in the human heart and the human soul, could you influence citizens everywhere in the world to see the better side of who and what we are as a species.

 I thank each and every one of you for this honor. And to my fellow honorees, I could have had no better company than to have shared this evening with each of you. Thank you very much.

 Thank you so much, everybody. And thank you, Phil, for what you said and what you gave me. He has already said what I wanted to say first, that today it's my daughter's, Iris, birthday. Which is a strange coincidence. So allow me to say, Iris, bon anniversaire. And then, of course I'm very grateful to the members of the Academy for accepting me as a new member and this totally unexpected Oscar.

 I think at the moment here tonight about some of the great directors I've been working with and who have already passed away. Like Luis Buñuel, of course, Jacques Tati, Louis Malle, Patrice Chéreau, Nagisa Ôshima, Marco Ferreri, Jacques Deray. They all taught me something, each of them. And they're always present, even today, even now in this moment, when I'm working and when I hear, I believe I hear their voices in my ears. In a way, they are all here tonight with us. And of course I think also about the directors who are still alive, like that one [pointing to Philip Kaufman onstage], and like Volker Schlöndorff that you saw in the film. Like Milos Forman, of course. Like Peter Brook, who is going to turn ninety pretty soon and still very much alive and working. So that's all I want to say. We – a screenwriter is nothing without a director. And with such directors as the ones I've been happy to work with, it's a gift. It's just a series of gifts.

 Now I'd like also to say something about the fact that this Oscar goes to a screenwriter. And I'm very happy of this because very often the screenwriters are forgotten, are ignored. They are like shadows passing through [the] history of cinema. Their names do not appear in the reviews, very seldom, but still they are filmmakers. That's why tonight I like to share this priceless statue with all my colleagues – the ones I know, the ones I don't know – from all over the world to share with them. So we all thank you.

Another fact of luck is that my country has not been at war for the fifty years that I have been making films. Of course we've profited from wars, but we're very fortunate that we have not had to go to war ourselves. But my greatest luck is that I've been able to meet Miss Maureen O'Hara today. So I've been so happy and feel so blessed with luck in my life. Thank you.

 Thank you. Thank you all so very much. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances. ""The Revenant"" was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. First off, to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tom Hardy. Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen. To Mr. Alejandro Iñárritu, as the history of cinema unfolds you have forged your way into history these past two years. What an unbelievable talent you are. Thank you to you and Chivo for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us. Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency, in particular Arnon Milchan. You were the champion of this endeavor. My entire team. I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career. Mr. Caton-Jones, for casting me in my first film. Mr. Scorsese, for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To Mr. Rick Yorn, thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. And to my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly; you know who you are.

 And lastly, I just want to say this. Making ""The Revenant"" was about man's relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity. For the indigenous people of the world. For the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this. For our children's children. And for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much.

 I've always, I've always just adored stories. Hearing them. Seeing them. Being in them. So for me to have the chance to work with, I think, one of the greatest storytellers of our time, Steven Spielberg, has just been such an honor. And unlike some of the leaders we're being presented with these days, he leads with such love that he's surrounded by masters in every craft on this film. Every craft. Not the least, Mr. Tom Hanks. People... I'm so pleased that our film has been nominated so many times, and as a face of the film I meet many people in the streets. And it's lovely to have them, they're always saying to me, ""would it help?"" and all that stuff. And I think if you ever wondered about acting with Tom Hanks, would it help? The answer's clearly yes.

 I want to just say thank you to my fellow nominees. I don't know how they separate my acting from your glorious acting in these wonderful films that you're in, which everyone must see. I don't know how they separated the five of us from all the other supporting actors who are making films at the moment. It's a wonderful time to be an actor and I'm proud to be part of it. Thank you.

Very quickly, if Iain Smith, our amazing executive producer from Scotland, hadn't sent me a text saying, ""whatcha doing at the moment?"" and then got me on a plane out to meet George Miller and Doug Mitchell, I wouldn't obviously be standing here. It was a year of our lives in the Namibian desert. We had the most amazing crew. I hope that some, I'd heard they were on ticker tape, I thought they'd, that the names were going on the screen. But honestly, if anybody wants to know more about any of them just get in touch with me through my wonderful agents Wayne Fitterman from William Morris and Sue Latimer from ARG. But it was an incredible experience. But I just want to say one quite serious thing and I've been thinking about this a lot.

To all the brave men out there, like my father and my husband, who push women to go to school and work and who want a more just society for women.

My father, a great jazz musician, he hated movies, so I was my mother's date and she would drag me to movies. And so my introduction to Martin Scorsese was when she took me to see ""Mean Streets."" Went away to college, [pointing to presenter Samuel L. Jackson] alma mater, Sam, Morehouse College. I'm a third generation Morehouse man. My grandfather went to Morehouse. My father went to Morehouse; he was a freshman when Martin Luther King was a senior. And my grandmother and my mother went to Spelman. These are two historic black schools across from each other, across the street from each other, in Atlanta, Georgia. Of course, Sam's wife is from Spelman.

 When I went to college I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I had to go to college, I had to go to Morehouse. So my first two years I was... lost in the wilderness. I was a D-plus, C-minus student. It wasn't 'cause I wasn't smart, just not motivated. So at the end of my sophomore year my advisor said, before it's time to go back home for the summer, go back to New York, she said, ""You have to think long and hard about choosin' a major."" And I said, ""Why?"" She said, ""Because you've exhausted all your electives.""

 So I came back to New York. The infamous summer of 1977. And I thought, up to that point you could always get a job in New York if you had your working papers, but that summer in 1977 New York City was broke. There's a famous Daily News front page: ""Ford to City"" – that's President Ford – ""Ford to City: Drop Dead."" There were no jobs. So I did not want to sit on my stoop and play Strat-O-Matic Baseball all summer – no one heard about Strat-, no one played Strat-O-Matic Baseball back here? Come on! [Lee applauds.] Somebody! Anyway. My team was the 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers. So that summer... it was crazy. It's really crazy because that summer I ended up making a film about that summer, Summer of Sam, so you never know how this stuff works.

 So one day I'm on my stoop – we call 'em stoops, not porches, in Brooklyn. And I'm gonna say let me go see my friend Vietta Davis. Now, she was very smart. New York City public high school is like this: Stuyverson, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech. And she was a genius. I mean, right then and there she knew she wanted to be a doctor, ended going to Princeton, then Harvard Med School. She's a doctor now in Chicago. Anyway, I'm gonna say let me see what she's doing. So I go to her house and I ring the bell, and she says come on up. And we're sittin' in the living room, and in the corner is a box. And I say, ""What's in the box?"" She says, ""A Super 8 camera. I'm gonna be a doctor so you can have it."" Then I say, ""What's in the other box?"" She says, ""That's film for a Super 8 camera. I'm gonna be a doctor, you can have it.""

 So, now I have something to do for the summer. I was not gonna play Start-O-Matic Baseball on the stoop all summer. And so it was a great summer to shoot because a couple of days later there was a blackout. It's a blackout, and so my father drove me around – we had a Citroën, yellow Citroën station wagon. So when my fellow brothers and sisters and my fellow Puerto Rican brothers and sisters started to loot, I filmed it. I went up to 125th St., Harlem, filmed the looting. Went into Fulton St. in Brooklyn. Choice items were color TVs, washin' machines, Pampers and Walt Frazier Clyde Pumas. And so I filmed that. And then that summer, in summer 1977, was the first summer of disco. So every block, weekends, people hookin' up their turntable and speakers to the street lamps, I was filming that. And then there was a guy named David Berkowitz, Son of Sam. So he had most of New York terrified. See, this is before gentrification. So back in 1977, if Son of Sam were to come into Harlem, Bed-Stuy, they would have killed him. Before – way, way back before gentrification.

 So I have all this footage and I go back to school and I say, I'm gonna be a mass communications major. And there's a teacher there, who's still teachin' there today, his name's Dr. Herb Eichelberger. He encouraged me to make a documentary out of this footage. The film was called ""Last Hustle in Brooklyn."" From then, my junior and senior years, I was a A-plus student. I was C– [applause] ...yeah. But the reason why – I didn't get any smarter; I just was interested. So, I don't say I found film, film found me.

 Moving forward. I graduate. I know that story about working your way up from the mailroom doesn't work for black people, so I say I'm gonna try to go to film school. So I apply to USC and AFI, and I don't get in USC or AFI because I don't have the astronomical score on a GRE. But lucky for me they had more forward thinking people at NYU, who said whether you get into film school or not shouldn't be determined by a standardized test. So I got in to NYU and that's where I met Ernest Dickerson. Great, great DP. Ernest and I were the only two people in the program. And we bonded automatically 'cause I went to Howard – excuse me – I went to Morehouse and he went to Howard. And here's the thing I'd like to say. The reason Ernest and I were successful, because our parents told us from a very early age that we had to be ten times better than our white classmates. That just being the same was not gonna be enough. That was instilled for me from the beginning. That we as a people here, if you're just trying to [Lee makes mid-level hand gesture]... nuh-huh. You gotta be better. You have to extra excel. You have to excel. So...

 DENZEL WASHINGTON:
 Nothing's changed.

 SPIKE LEE:
 Come on, ""Nothing's changed."" That's D right there, the man!

 So! Three years of film school. I do a film, my thesis film is called ""Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop"" and it wins the Student Academy Award. I won the Student Academy Award back in 1983. So I had a agent. Man, I thought that Spielberg's gonna call me, Lucas, Fox, Universal. And I had a little apartment off Myrtle Ave. on Fort Greene, before gentrification. So I had my – now the Student Academy Award is not like this [pointing to the Oscar statuette]. It's a wooden box with a circle with this [the Oscar image] on it. So I know for sure, because I have a Student Academy Award, I'm gonna take over Hollywood. But a funny thing happens. When you don't pay Ma Bell, you don't pay Con Edison, and you don't pay Brooklyn Union Gas, the phone gets turned off, the heat gets turned off, and lights get turned off. So I was in the dark just by havin' my Student Academy Award. And then I woke up. And so that's when I learned a tough lesson: Nothin' happens overnight. There's no such thing as a overnight success. And that's the biggest thing we do to our young people, to tell them that there's a thing, a animal, as a overnight success. You have to bust your ass, roll up your sleeves and attack, attack, attack, attack, every single day. And that's what I've been tellin' my film students at NYU for the last 15 years.

 [Looking down at his notes:] Let me turn a page here.

 DENZEL WASHINGTON:
 How many pages you got, Spike?

 SPIKE LEE:
 Two more, D! [Laughs.] So, at this point...

 WESLEY SNIPES:
 I told you about patience, didn't I? I told you about having a lot of patience when you're working with this guy.

 SPIKE LEE:
 So, I'd like to say I'm very happy. You know, this is a great night. My family's here, and many friends, people I work with, but it's not been easy. And I'm just as proud – as this award – as a people, we got into this industry, behind and in front of the camera. That was always the goal. It's like, if I got in I was gonna try to bring as many mutherfuckers with me as possible. It'd be like Public Enemy, bum rush the show! 'Cause they're coming in here.

 ""Malcolm X."" We're gettin' ready to shoot ""Malcolm X,"" and we're meetin' with the Teamsters. I say, ""Sir –"" Tommy O'Donnell. I say, ""Sir, do you have any black Teamsters?"" He says, ""No."" I said, ""That's a problem."" I said, ""Until you get some black Teamsters, we're gonna have the Fruit of Islam drive trucks. And if you wanna come to the set and fuck with the Fruit of Islam, come on."" Next day five black Teamsters showed up. But some people don't do that. But I don't care about that, I knew I had to make changes like that or we wouldn't be where we are today.

 In closing... [Lee looks at audience and applauds.] In closing – I always say this, but if it's been redundant then please forgive me. I wanna thank my grandmother – Sam, you met my grandmother – Zimmie Shelton Lee. Her grandmother was a slave, yet she graduated with a college degree. And for 50 years she taught art. Van Gogh was her favorite painter. For 50 years she taught art in the state of Georgia. And for 50 years she never had one white student because of Jim Crow laws in that state, and for 50 years white students missed on a great art teacher. And for 50 years my grandmother saved her social security checks for her grandchildren's education. And since I was the first born, I had first dibs. So my grandmother, through 50 years of saving her social security checks, put me through Morehouse, put me through NYU Film School, gave me the money for my thesis film, and then gave me the money for ""She's Gotta Have It.""

 And I wanna commend the President, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, because she is tryin' to do somethin' needs to be done. I don't know if you know this but the United States Census Bureau says that by the year 2043, white Americans are gonna be a minority in this country. And for all the people out there who are in position of hiring, you better get smart because your workforce should reflect what this country looks like. And I'm gonna get real here. Everybody in here probably voted for Obama, but when I go to offices I ain't see no black folks except brother man at the security guard, who checks my name off the list as I go into the studio. So we could talk, you know, yabba-yabba-yabba, but we need to have some serious discussion about diversity and get some flava up in this. This industry is so behind sports it's ridiculous. It's easier to be the President of the United States as a black person than be the head of studio. Honest! It's easier to be the President of the United States than to be head of a studio, or head of a network. Let's leave Oprah out of it. She doesn't count. So, President, keep it going. I know it's tough, we've got a long way to go. Peace and love to people in France. And my last thing [holding up the statuette]... is Brooklyn in the house?! [Shouts and cheers from audience.] Brooklyn's in the house. Thank you very much.

2015,88,2015-11-14,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Cate Blanchett, Laura Linney, Nick Cassavetes",Honorary Award,", who has illuminated the human experience through her brilliant, passionate and fearless performances.",NA,NA,Gena Rowlands,"GENA ROWLANDS:
 Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I do thank all of you. I thank you, Cate, and Laura, and Angie, and you, big boy.

 NICK CASSAVETES:
 You're welcome.

 GENA ROWLANDS:
 So, good evening. I want to thank the Academy's Board of Governors for this wonderful evening. I feel truly honored to be here. And, you know what's wonderful about being an actress is you don't just live one life – yours – you live many lives. And for that we have to thank the writers. After all, they're the ones who start out with a piece of blank paper and they create the story. And then they create the characters in the story, and that gives us actors the opportunity to, hopefully, bring all of those characters to life. And that's another wonderful thing about being an actress. You get to work with a lot of people, often other actors, that you have long admired. I was especially lucky because I got to work with Bette Davis, my all-time favorite.

 We did a picture called ""Strangers,"" and I was thrilled to death when I heard that she was cast. And one day, we were finished with the day's work, and we went down to see the dailies, the film that we shot the day before. And we went to the screening room and they turned off the lights and they started the film. And I sat there like all actors do at the dailies, watching myself. Seeing if I did that too slowly, or if I didn't know, or it [wasn't] quite right, or if it was okay. And it did seem okay that day, so I was very happy.

 And the lights went on and I started to gather my stuff to leave, and I looked over, and way in the far aisle was Bette and the cameraman. And they were too far away for me to hear what they were saying, but their body language was eloquent. Bette was... [Rowland points and gestures angrily]. And the cameraman was... [Rowlands smiles and makes placating gestures]. And since I was still, you know, I was so far away, I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I decided that this might be a good time for me to leave. And as I started for the door, Bette called out ""Gena!"" She said, ""Would you wait just a moment, please? I need to talk to you."" And I said, ""Sure."" And she walked over to me, her eyes were still just blazing. And she said, ""Did you see my lips?""

 I thought she was kidding. So I said, ""No, did you lose them?"" And she said, ""That isn't funny. I mean my lips on the film that we just saw. They were bright orange! An unnatural orange! And [pointing] that's his fault, because he's the cameraman and he has the say-so about what colors are on the screen. So I think we ought to get rid of him, don't you?"" And I said, ""Well, Bette, to tell you the truth I wasn't paying strict attention, I wasn't noticing the details, you know, of the colors at all, and I just let my mind wander, I guess."" And she said, ""Oh really? You weren't concentrating? You let your mind wander? Well, let me tell you something. You better start concentrating and paying attention to detail because I'm telling you, you're no spring chicken yourself."" But she was so funny; we had a great time.

 Well, I don't want to talk your heads off, but I would feel remiss if I didn't mention my late husband John Cassavetes. He wrote me the most magnificent parts – and for other actresses, too – and sometimes he directed them, and I surely do have to thank him for that. Oh, and I did want to thank the Board of Governors for introducing me to this fine fellow [puts her hand on the statuette]. Tall and shiny and gold; very handsome. You know, he's just so elegant that I'll – that is if nobody objects – I think I'll take him home with me tonight. And I'll find... [looks for her son Nick, who holds up the statuette to applause].

 NICK CASSAVETES:
 Blow 'em a kiss, Mom.

 GENA ROWLANDS:
 [Rowlands throws a kiss to the audience.] And I'll find a wonderful place for him to sit. Maybe on the piano. And then everyone who comes to my house will have a chance to see him and admire him and love him the way I do. So thanks, Governors, and I'm very happy to see all of you here tonight in the audience. I'm happy to have been able to spend some time with you. Thank you.

And to all the other nominees, you did great work. I'm proud to be in your company. You guys are very brave and I admire what you do. I'm only here, really, because of all the talents and goodwill of so many people; they're impossible to name. But most of all Kenneth Lonergan, who made this part, and without this part and without his writing I wouldn't be here for sure. And well, he directed it. Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say, but I'm just, I'm really proud to be a part of this community in general. I look out at all of you, I have this whole year, and I'm just dumbfounded that I'm included. It means a lot to me. Thank you also to Matt Damon for creating this opportunity. To Mara Buxbaum, for so much. And to Patrick and Boomer, and so many people. Of course my mother and my father, for mostly, usually, believing in me in doing this. And Ben, I love you; you ain't heavy. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it.

 [Buttoning his jacket] My grandma would want me to button up. Wow. I want to thank my teachers, my professors. Have so many wonderful teachers. And one thing that they consistently told me – Zelda Fichandler, Ron Van Lieu, Ken Washington – is that it wasn't about you. It's not about you. It's about these characters. You are a servant, you're in service to these stories and these characters, and I'm so blessed to have had an opportunity. It was about ""Juan."" It was about ""Chiron."" It was about ""Paula."" The cast and crew was just such a wonderful experience. Thank you, Barry Jenkins. Thank you, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Adele Romanski, who forced Barry to cast me. [Laughs.] No, but it's just such a wonderful experience and I have so many people to thank who've gotten me here. My manager Carolyn Govers, who I've been with for 10 years. Just thank you so much. And the rest of the cast who did wonderful work, any one of them could be up here right now holding this trophy. It's such a gift getting to work with you and be inspired by you and the performances that you all offered up. So thank you, the Academy. Really appreciate this. And lastly, I just want to thank my wife who was in her third trimester during awards season. We just had our daughter four days ago. So, I just want to thank her for being just such a soldier through this process, and help, and really carrying me through it all. So thank you. Really appreciate it. Peace and blessings.

 Thank you to the Academy. You know, there's one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered. One place. And that's the graveyard. People ask me all the time, ""What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"" And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here's to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.

 And to Bron Pictures, Paramount, MACRO, Todd Black, Molly Allen, Scott Rudin for being the cheerleaders for a movie that is about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness and grace. And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I've ever worked with. And, ""O captain, my captain,"" Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.

 And to Dan and Mae Alice Davis, who were the, and are the center of my universe. The people who taught me, good or bad, how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose. My parents. I'm so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world. To my sisters. My sister Deloris, who's here, who played Jaji and Jaja with me. We were rich white women in the tea party games. Thank you for the imagination. And to my husband and my daughter, my heart, you and Genesis. You teach me every day how to live, how to love. I'm so glad that you are the foundation of my life.

My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression.

Thank you to Jamie Feldman, to Gary Gilbert. Thank you to my parents for supporting my choice to pursue a career in the arts even though it was a little bit crazy. Arthur Horowitz, you are my fantasy baby. And to my kind, generous, talented, beautiful, blue-eyed wife and creative partner, Julia Hart, you have inspired me to become the man I am right now, and more importantly the man I'm still becoming. There's a lot of love in this room, and let's use it to create and champion bold and diverse work, work that inspires us towards joy, towards hope, and towards empathy.

 MARC PLATT (Best Picture nominee, ""La La Land""):
 [1:32] Here's to the fools who made me dream: my uncle Gary Platt; my mentor Sam Cohn; my parents; my children; my wife, Julie, on whose shoulders I've stood for 40 years, because she insisted I reach for the stars. And to the Hollywood community that I'm so proud to be a part of, and to the Hollywood in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, [behind Platt, a production crew member is showing the other two producers the correct winner card] repression is the enemy of civilization. So keep dreaming, because the dreams we dream today will provide the love, the compassion and the humanity that will narrate the stories of our lives tomorrow. Fred?

COATES:
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, Academy Governors, for giving me this award. I feel very honored and excited, until I realized I had to make a speech. There was a reason I stayed behind the camera. Seriously though, I feel so lucky to have had this wonderful life doing a job I love, working with some of the finest directors of the last 50 years on some of the most fascinating scripts ever written. And to top it off, travel around the globe to some of the planet's most incredible and mesmerizing locations. And can you imagine a job where you are actually paid to look into the eyes of George Clooney, Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, Peter Finch, Sean Connery, Albert Finney, Clint Eastwood, Richard Gere, Daniel Craig, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and those of ""50 Shades of Grey"" himself, Jamie Dornan?

 My life has been so varied that I always say, I work with directors ranging from David Lean to David Lynch, Sir Carroll Reed to Steven Soderbergh, and Sidney Lumet to Wolfgang Peterson, and many other talented ones in between. Too many to mention; too many to upset that I didn't mention them, because you know how directors are. But I would like to thank them all for the good times, the manic and creative times, and even those times they keep me in the cutting room until the wee hours seven days a week. I might mumble something incoherent at the time, but looking back I wouldn't change a thing.

 But of all those, I still have to say my greatest production are my three wonderful and talented children, without whose love and support I would not be up here today. My two sons, Anthony and James Hickox, are both writer/directors. My eldest, Anthony, has made over 30 feature films, and my youngest, James, isn't far behind him, having just spent six weeks in Greece shooting – lucky him. And of course, in the middle of these two is my daughter Emma, who swore she would never follow in my footsteps but somehow ended up a fabulous editor and is now taking my jobs. Between them they have gifted me four grandchildren. The eldest, my lovely Olivia. And then the gorgeous – Emma's two gorgeous, Mathilda and Alexander. And the newest arrival, Florence. I like to call them my own little dynasty.

 So thank you once more for this very special award. I have to say I never suspected I would be holding one of these in my hand again. I like to think that I can share this with all the editors, the unsung heroes out there, most of them probably still working frantically as I speak, as this type of special award reminds us that we do not do so entirely unnoticed. Good night, and may whichever God you believe in bless you.

 I love you. It's so inspiring. My heartfelt thanks to the Academy Governors. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that I would be standing here. And so many individuals contributed to my fulfilling career. Robert Wise was responsible for my start in motion pictures, which then gave me an opportunity to collaborate with many of the most gifted directors in film history. They were always open to a new talent they'd never encountered. And incidentally, ""opened"" is one of my favorite words. Because as I've said many times, you never know where or when you will find the answer. And I've found the answer in some very strange places. My search for the ideal choice led me to nearly every state in the United States, all around America. And in 1961 John Sturges sent me to Europe to cast ""The Great Escape,"" and that allowed me to explore actors in so many remarkable locations and bring an authenticity – Germans playing Germans, Brits, and the rest of the cast. It was just an amazing experience. And my career has never been boring or lacking in surprises.

 Norman Jewison, who's here tonight – I love so many people and he's certainly high on that list. We had a lot of fun together. It was really – you know and not just serious work, but joy. But there must be some major attention to detail. To never compromise is the key, no matter what the size of the role. Even if it's a reaction to something another actor is bringing. And it allowed me to reach out a helping hand and find opportunities for actors and actresses from the theater just embarking on their careers. Sometimes just a line or two, and sometimes with a role that became a stepping stone to great acclaim. Boy, does that warm the heart. And I treasure the ongoing relationships I've had with so many actors: Jeff Bridges, Bruce Dern, Andy Garcia, Martin Landau, John Travolta and Christopher Reeve, who I loved as a human being as well as his talent. So many gifted individuals have touched my life.

 And I want to express my special appreciation to my associates and my assistants through the years. It would have been impossible for me to be able to concentrate and give a hundred percent to each director without their tireless contribution. Casting is alive and well in the new millennium. I so admire the achievements of today's casting directors and I'm so impressed with their creative contributions. And of course, the frosting on the cake tonight is having my loving family here with me. My son and daughter, my grandchildren, Nicholas and Kaylabella*, and my dear friends, to share this incredible honor and momentous occasion. I love you. Thank you.

 Thank you. Thank you. I'm very pleased to be here to receive the Board of Governors Honorary Academy Award. It's a great and wonderful recognition of the work I've been doing for 50 years. What's kept me going is that it's fun and an adventure. Constantly working also keeps me off the street, or at least on the streets that I like. While making the movies is physically and intellectually demanding it's rare that I felt any strain. I'm lucky I found work that I like and that I continue to be obsessed with. This compulsion has always been understood by my wife, Zipporah, and my sons, David and Eric. I am grateful and very appreciative for their constant support. They recognized long ago that I'm a New England Jewish Puritan and let me go my errant ways. I'm also very pleased that my grandchildren, Tess and Ben and Charlie, are here tonight to help me celebrate.

 I want to thank Karen Konicek, who has run my production company, Zipporah Films, for 35 years, and whose unfailing good cheer and sound advice has made it possible to wander around and make movies. I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to John Davey, the terrific cameraman with whom I worked since 1979. I'm glad that both John and Karen are here tonight. I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the late William Brayne, the cameraman who worked with me on many earlier films. And also I want to thank the many others who helped in the production of the movies. Irwin Young, the President of DuArt Films, one of independent filmmaker's best friends, provided deferment deals which made many of my early films possible. I'm grateful to PBS for its support for all of my films. The films couldn't have made without – couldn't have not have been made without the constant support of The Ford Foundation and frequent grants from the MacArthur, Pershing Square, and LEF Foundations, ITVS and the Sundance Documentary Fund. Additional funding has sometimes been provided by my singing and selling pencils outside Neiman Marcus department stores.

 Making a movie is always an adventure. I usually know nothing about the subject before I start, and I know there are those that feel I know nothing about it when it's finished. I never start with a point of view about the subject or a thesis that I want to prove. I also don't do any research in advance of the shooting. I usually don't know in advance what's going to be shot or what I'm gonna stumble across in any day or any moment of any day. The editing is an effort to impose order on the chaos of the rushes through the creation of a fictional form that provides meaning to the film. The goal is to make a film that is close to a, closer to a visual novel than a journalistic account. This process involves sitting in the editing room for eight to ten months, getting fed intravenously until the film is found.

 Each film is also an opportunity to learn something about a new subject. I've been involved in a 50-year course in adult education, where I'm the alleged adult who studies a new subject every year. The variety and complexity of the human behavior observed in making one of the films, and cumulatively all of the films, is staggering. And I think it is as important to document kindness, civility and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference. There are always a lot of laughs and I'm not the first to observe that so much of human behavior, my own and others, is when seen from a detached point of view, funny. For example, when I was working on the film that became ""Near Death,"" a film about dying patients, there were several occasions when we shot in the hospital morgue. On the last day of shooting I went around thanking the various staff who had been helpful. Among them was a man responsible for the morgue.

 Well, my deepest thanks to the Academy and its members for this glorious prize. I owe this and so much more to so many. I've lived in America for the longest time and I am deeply grateful to her for the loves and the friendships I have made and the many wonderful gifts it has given me: my home, my livelihood, my family and now Oscar. The movies, such is their power, captivated a young man from South London and gave him a dream. And Douglas Urbanski, my dear, dear friend and brother, you have helped keep that dream alive. Joe Wright, thank you for this [holding out the Oscar]. It only took twenty years for us to work together, but it was well worth the wait. Thank you, Kazu, Lucy, David, for your artistry. Thank you, everyone at Working Title and Universal Focus, for your herculean efforts and support on this film. Thank you, Eric Fellner, Tim Bevan, Lisa Bruce, Anthony McCarten. Dani and her amazing team. And of course, Jim Osborne.

 I would just like to salute Sir Winston Churchill who has been marvelous company on what can be described as an incredible journey, and my wife Gisele for traveling that road with me and being at my side. Thank you, Alfie, Gully, Charlie, William. My remarkable, remarkable fellow nominees, and my dear friend out there, Denzel. And obviously I'm not gonna win the, uh, you know, the ski. I would like to thank my mother who is older than the Oscar. She is 99 years young next birthday, and she is watching this ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother: Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on, I'm bringing Oscar home.

Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins, Christopher Plummer, Woody Harrelson: You guys rock! You inspire me, and you always have. When I was eight years old I was called into the principal's office.

We're going to the movies."" My mom and dad's love of movies became my love of movies, so thank you for that, Mom and Dad. I love you.

And in the last twenty-five years, I've been living in a country all of our own: part of it is here, part of it is in Europe, part of it is everywhere. Because I think that the greatest thing our art does and our industry does is to erase the lines in the sand. We should continue doing that when the world tells us to make them deeper.

 The place I like to live the most is at Fox Searchlight, because in 2014 they came to listen to a mad pitch with some drawings and the story and a maquette. And they believed that a fairy tale about an amphibian god and mute woman done in the style of Douglas Sirk, and a musical, and a thriller was a sure bet. I wanna thank the people that have come with me all the way: Kimmy, Robert, Gary, Wayne and George, and my kids. And I wanna say like Jimmy Cagney said once: My mother thanks you.

They didn't want to see anything that they had seen before because they had this end-of-the-quarter screening, which they crucified you if they'd see anything that, anything actually that looked like Hollywood had made it, you know. So it was sort of an anti-Hollywood feel at the time. But it's since changed, you know, it's gotten to be more so. But I think, the thing is that I had some really wonderful teachers there, and one particular one, Basil Wright, who is a documentary filmmaker. He did ""Song of Ceylon"". I remember having difficulty when I first went to UCLA, in terms of not knowing what to do. Because when I was there, they had the end-of-the-quarter screenings which were the best films that they made at UCLA. But they were all about flower children, you know, people who made films in Topanga Canyon, you know, and were explaining or exploring their own sexuality and stuff like that. But where I came from that wasn't an issue, you know. It was about getting a job and keeping a job, you know. And so those are the kind of films I wanted to do, and it was Basil Wright who sort of pointed me in that direction.

 And the other thing that made it worthwhile and gave me some guidance was the fact that there were people of color who came, and we had these meetings every night, you know. We lived at UCLA, we went down to Westwood and spent all night in the restaurants, you know, till they kicked us out. And we talked about what is a black film continuously. You know, what is our responsibility? What do we have to do? And out of that came people like Julie Dash, Haile Gerima, and a whole bunch of other people who are well-known at the moment. But we also were a part of the civil rights movement, you know. I grew up in the 50s and 60s, and our obligation was to tell our stories because Hollywood, and I don't mean any disrespect, but they had been distorting our image since ""Birth of a Nation"", you know. So it was incumbent upon us to tell our story, our narrative in our own way. And so my interest in film and my ideas came from that period, in working with a bunch of students like myself who were interested in making a difference and using film as a means for social change.

 You know, in this business you get a lot of negatives, you know, a lot of rejection. And my first rejection—and it sort of prepared me for, you know, this business in a certain way—was when I was in junior high school. I had a teacher, and it was a history class, and I had a speech impediment; it was very bad. I guess this teacher thought I was, you know, had mental problems or something, I don’t know. But anyway, he one day stood in front of the class and he looked over the class and he walked down the aisle and he pointed to different students, and he said, you're not gonna be anything. And he went down the aisle saying to each one. And he came to me and pointed his finger and said, you're not gonna be anything. Okay. And I remember that. I remember to this day; in fact, I've never forgotten because it always had an impact on me. And because of that I never really felt secure in what I was doing. I always thought that it was something that I couldn't do, and that it wouldn't have any meaning, or it just wasn't worthy. And so I never really felt that what I was doing had any—in spite of the fact that I studied with these other film people, that what we needed to do was make film a tool for social change—I still had these problems of thinking that what I did had some significance and, or meaning. But things like this, getting awards like this, really make what was said in the past insignificant, you know, what words were given, these unkind words, you know. So people ask me when I was out on the red carpet getting interviews and pictures taken, and they say, well, what does it mean to you getting this? Well, it means that, you know, I'm getting further and further away from this stigma. I mean, there's this feeling that, you know, that it's not going to have any meaning, that I don't have, you know, what it takes to make things work. But one of the things that, what tonight does, in a way—the teacher that I was talking about, his name is Mr. Baker. And I don't know if he's still around, but if he is I do hope he reads the trades, you know.

 But one other—I'm probably rambling and going on—but there's one other thing I'd like to comment on. I mean, I have these words I've written but I see they cut them off because I'm not following the script, so I apologize for that. Because, anyway. But this last bit of story I'll tell you. When I was working on ""To Sleep with Anger"", it was a company, a TV company that wanted to develop the story. And we started off with this other story I wanted, but they started to screw around and wanted to make changes. But it was based on a real-life story, a lady who was killed in my community by a gang member. And the police talked her into being an eyewitness, to testify in court. And she did, but they gave her name out in the press and one of the gang members killed her, you know, killed this lady. And I thought the whole system failed, so I wanted to do a story about that. And so this company started to screw around with the script and wanted to turn it into, you know, something altogether different. It had no meaning in anything. And so I said, no. So I said, let me do something that has no particular meaning; it's fictional, make believe. And so I started writing ""To Sleep with Anger"". And so, you know, it's a story about two generations. And it's a family situation where one of the sons follows tradition, the other son doesn't. You know, he sort of like wants to get rich and he doesn't care about anything except for money.

 So anyway, there was a long scene I wrote. And the company that I was developing the film with, how they had impact on the film was, on the story was that you would send in an outline, a treatment, and if it's something they like they'll send a check. If it's something they don't like they'll tell you, well, the check is upstairs, you know. So you would send something in; well, the check is upstairs. That means, go back and rewrite it, you know. Well, somebody said, well, why don't you send the check downstairs and put it in the mail? No, we'll, we'll... It can happen, you know. And so this would go on and on. Until there was a scene that I wrote, it was quite long and so they rejected it and said, the check is up in the mail. I said, well, I saw this PBS story about a Horton Foote story, and there's a long scene on the veranda that went on and on and on. And they said, yeah, but you're not Horton Foote, you know. Okay. So I took the script back and got another producer who was in favor of doing the film, that liked it. And so many years later—this will be short. Many years later, I had finished a film in Africa, I was doing post-production in Africa, you know. So I get this call from the States and they said, we want to give you an award. I said, fine. They said, but you have to be here to get it. I said, but I'm in Africa right now. Well, you have to be here. And I said, well, can't someone else get it? They said, no, you have to be here. And so I'm getting kinda angry a bit, you know. And so I'm trying to be cool, so I say, well, are you sure I can't come... He said, no, no, no. I said, but I'm in Africa. It takes fourteen hours to get there...and all this sort of thing. But you have to be here. Okay. So, I said, well, what is the award? They said, well, it's the Horton Foote Writing Award. So I said, I'll be there. So anyway, thanks a great deal. It's meaningful. Thank you.

 Thanks, Daryn and Larry and Dustin. I couldn't think of three people I'd rather have give me this Oscar. I'd like to thank the Board of Governors of the Academy for selecting me for this prestigious and humbling honor. This night means so much to me, and my heartiest congratulations to the other honorees. I can't begin to tell you how thrilled I am to be here tonight among so many extraordinary artists.

 My dear friend from New York, Dick DiBona, back in the early 70s, based on my commercial work, recommended me to Billy Friedkin to shoot ""The French Connection"" — and the rest is history. When I first started shooting features, an old stagehand told me that he thought it was Orson Welles who said, you know, this is a very collaborative effort, making movies. Film is made up of many tiny silver particles and each one of those particles is represented by every person who works on the film. You can imagine how many different people I've worked with, and had you changed any one of them on any movie, the movie would have looked different. I had the great fortune to work with so many artists and visionaries: producers, writers, directors, production designers, set decorators, grips, gaffers, the list goes on and on. And of course, my wonderfully talented camera crews. I can't take the time to name everybody, but collectively I can thank everybody. I'm grateful for all of these wonderful collaborators I've had over the years who have contributed to the composition, focus, lighting and movement of my work. I would be remiss if I didn't mention all of the brilliant actors and actresses I had the opportunity to photograph during the course of my career.

 I want to mention my son Eric who has followed in my footsteps, which I guess must mean that I'm some kind of decent role model, right? So you can call him [unintelligible]. Finally and most especially, thanks to my gorgeous Swedish wife, Mona, who has been my rock for all this time. I'm extremely grateful for this special honor. Thank you very much.

 [Sighs] I made it to the toilet. Older people with smaller bladders, it would be wonderful if the toilets in this building were a little closer. Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you, Ronald. God, I'd love to invite them to my funeral. Two months ago we were in Rome, Francine Racette and I. It was the sixth of September. I had just finished a day's shooting of ""Trust"" for Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, and we were sitting on the little balcony of our hotel rooms. It was so narrow that if I put the soles of my feet on the railings, my knees came up nearly to my chest. But it was above the rooftops. It was a block behind—it was beautiful. It was the early evening; it was warm. Piazza del Popolo was off to the right, Via del Corso was just in front of us. We had a little table between the two of us and on it were two plates of room service spaghetti marinara and a bottle of Acqua Panna. And my phone rang. My American phone.

 Now, I have been inundated for months by callers from unrecognized numbers telling me that I had just been approved for a bank loan, or for a mortgage. I'd tell them: Stop talking, take my name off your list, and hang up! And then I hang up and I put a block on their number. I picked up my phone. I looked at it. I did not recognize the number. And so, gruffly—I mean, really gruffly—I said, ""Hello?"" And the man's voice on the other end said, ""Donald, it's John Bailey."" John Bailey? John Bailey is the cinematographer of ""Ordinary People""; that was 37 years ago. I said, ""Hello, John!"" He said, ""Donald, I've been made President of the Academy."" I said, ""Congratulations!"" He said, ""No, I'm calling to congratulate you,"" and he explained. I asked him if he would speak with Francine, because Francine had known John and Carol from before, and I passed the phone to her. And she talked for a little bit and then said goodbye and put the phone down. And we sat there. Finally, she looked at me and she said, ""We're going to have to lose weight."" I looked at her. I looked at the spaghetti. And I said, ""We'll start tomorrow."" So we ate the spaghetti. It was cold. It was also the best spaghetti I have eaten in my entire life!

 This [holding up the Oscar], this is very important to me, to my family. It's like a, like a door has opened and a cool, wonderfully fresh breath of air has come in. I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life. I'd love to be able to thank the multitude of people who are responsible for me being here: Ingo Preminger, Renata Adler, Brian Hutton, Robert Aldrich, Christopher Plummer, Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci, Christian Duguay, John Schlesinger, Nicolas Roeg, Fred Schepisi—none of us has time for me to go all the way through that list this evening. But I would like to say thank you to Ronald Meyer, who has been with me, and behind me, for as long as I can remember. Thank you to dear Josh Lieberman, Jerry Longarzo, Catherine Olim, Elan Ruspoli. And thank you to my children, my grandchildren. Our son Roeg called us in Rome a couple of hours after John had called, and he was weeping—that's what this means to our family. He was sobbing so hard it was incomprehensible. And finally I understand that he was trying to tell me that this [holding out the Oscar], this was going to look really wonderful in his office at CAA. He even as a young child, he had an impeccable sense of the ridiculous. And, of course, thank you to Francine Racette, from whom everything has come—that's my family—from whom everything has come, and to whom everything is owed. I have been a partner to her for over 45 years, and in all that she has supported me with her intelligence, her intuition, her instruction, her ability to make me laugh in the direst of situations, her extraordinary sense of taste, her residual belief in me. Amongst all of these, her ability to absorb and sustain the extraordinary ups and downs of this crazy movie life we have gone through. I mean, she deserves a medal for that. So, Francine, I'm going to get you a medal.

 And I would like to say thank you to the Governors of the Academy. Thank you for putting my name on this. It is incredibly generous of you, and I'm profoundly appre—54 people to give this. It's, it's extraordinary for me. I have to tell you that I have been beset by my mind's unrelenting interrogation of me, demanding if I deserve this. And in that quandary I finally found peace in the words of the great Benjamin Kubelsky, who is also known as Jack Benny, when he said, as I say to you now: ""I don't deserve this. But I have arthritis and I don't deserve that either."" Thank you.

2017,90,2017-11-13,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Kimberly Peirce, Kate Amend, Jessica Chastain, Angelina Jolie",Honorary Award,"Agnès , whose compassion and curiosity inform a uniquely personal cinema.",NA,NA,Varda,"AGNÈS VARDA:
 I'm slightly shy and delighted to hear all these beautiful words about me. Yes, it makes me feel good I have to say. And I hear them in the middle of Oscarland. I want to thank the four bright, beautiful and intelligent women who spoke. And I have a little question. Are there no men in this room who love me to speak up?

 Home in France, when we want to watch the Oscar ceremony we have to set up our alarm clock at 4 a.m. And we want to see the fashion show, the room full of excited people, not to speak about the anxious actors and artists, because it's a fierce competition. What's happening today has nothing to do; it's another kind. There is no money at stake and no competition. So the Governors gave me this award. It just, I took it as recognition of my body of work over the more than sixty years. And it, how you say, enlight, it gives light on me as well as French cinema. And I'm happy that some of the leading figures of France came to be with me and enjoy the event, the evening. So I want to welcome them. Frédérique Bredin is the president of Centre National du Cinéma, that supports film and helps young filmmakers. Then we have Serge Toubiana, who is the president of UniFrance Film, supporting films and helping young directors and sending the knowledge of French cinema abroad. And then we have the délégué général of the Cannes Film Festival, the famous Thierry Frémaux.

 I'm also surrounded and protected by my family. I have my beautiful children. Mathieu Demy, who is actor and filmmaker. Rosalie Varda-Demy, who recently produced with passion and energy the film ""Faces Places"" that I co-directed with JR. JR is here with us. And then cherries on the cake, two of my grandchildren are here. Valentin Vignet, who is a DP, and after studying at AFI. Yes. And my little Constantin Demy, who is still at school here in Los Angeles. How could I forget to name and speak about Jacques Demy, my dear Jacques who was here in 1965 nominated for ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"".

 Back to the topic. I have been under loved and praise I would say because I try to work to get the essence of cinema, finding different structure for each film. ""La Pointe Courte"", double narration. ""Cléo from 5 to 7"", real time. ""Vagabond"", thirteen continuous and un-continuous traveling shots. ""Jane B."", each portrait is a puzzle with missing pieces. So, I also try to tell stories with actors and non-actors, and went back to the school of modesty, which is documentaries, such as ""The Gleaners and I."" But I have to say I had a hard time finding money. I never, my film never made money and I'm not bankable. Nevertheless, if not money, I got many awards. And then also honorary awards, such as Cannes Palme d'Or, and later, because I became older and older without losing my desire and need to work and create, I started to get lifetime achievement awards. But here in the mecca of cinema, Hollywood, I received the best one, the Governors Award. Thank you.

 And then, I have to say something else. You know, the other day I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about my speech. I got nervous, started to move my legs and my arms in the bed, moving a lot. And after a while, for some reason, I start to forget the weight of my body on the mattress. I felt I was dancing. Tonight I have almost the same feeling. It is a big event, very serious, has been organized to celebrate the honorees. We have a room here full of cinema talents. We had two stars, Angelina and Jessica, like my feminist guardian angels. And it was a big event, very serious, full of meaning and weight. But I feel that between weight and lightness, I choose lightness. And I feel I'm dancing, the dance of cinema. [She then dances at the side of the podium with presenter Angelina Jolie.]

 Well, I would like to thank the Academy Board of Governors for this honorable recognition, which moves me deeply. As a Mexican, as an artist, and most importantly as a human being, I thank you from the depths of my heart for taking the time to experience CARNE y ARENA and honoring it with this Special Award. And there is no better prize in life than the one that you win without competing. And with no award seasons. And to share this space with great, great masters, Madame Agnès Varda, Owen Roizman, Charles Burnett, and Donald Sutherland. It's a dream.

 This project was born as a creative experiment with no commercial or profit intention, and so many people just trusted in it and gave so much even when we didn't know how to do it or how it will end. And I would like to thank them first. I would like to thank first my dear friend and collaborator, Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki. [Makes a salute] Chivo. This project will not be what it is without his genius. To Mary Parent, producer, friend and guardian angel of this project. Mary, you and Legendary made this project possible; thank you very much. To Miuccia Prada, who was the first co-conspirator of this idea five years ago, and her team at Fondazione Prada. To Laurene Powell Jobs and Emerson Collective, for their support and commitment to the cause of immigrants. To producer Katie Calhoon and her passion. To Tim Alexander and the team of ILM. To Ethan Stearns for his devotion and Philip Messina for his beautiful design. My brother Martín Hernández, Carsten Nicolai, Randy Thom, Steve Golin, Neil Kellerhouse, and the real VR pioneer, Nonny de la Peña. To Arnon Milchan, for make the installation at LACMA possible, and to Michael Govan and his team at LACMA for taking us even when this was only an idea. To Thierry Frémaux, Michael Mann, and John Bailey, for their support and belief in this project. To Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón, for their friendship and always, always wise and dangerous advice. To Gustavo Flores, Eric Hedayat, Javier Chapa, Eduardo Vazquez, Jorge Volpi, Ricardo Raphael, La Ciudad de Mexico, UNAM and the Tlatelolco Museum. To Alejandro Ramírez, for helping make this installation in Mexico possible. To Meyer Sound, for donating their equipment and their services. To María Eladia, my wife. My son and my daughter, Eliseo and María Eladia, who I love, and con quien comparto la conciencia de inmigrantes. And finally, but not any less important, to Federico Bustamante, director of Casa Libre, and to each and every one of the immigrants who trust us and participate in this project, sharing their stories to the world. And they made this project something theirs(?) and really true.

 I will like now to say, and to share some reflection, and I promise I will do my best to improve my very bad English. But I want to say that our—only, only ideologies have fuck up the world. Not the people, but the ideas we have about those people. And these ideas and the ideas that they have about us, those ideas are attached to words. Words that only serve to reiterate and reaffirm those ideas, our ideas. But the idea of a thing, place, or person is not the actual thing, place or person. It is just an abstraction. A word is just an interpretation that inevitably pigeonholes and reduce the complex and true reality of that thing, place, or person. Ideologies, as its name indicates, only feed from ideas, and words are the bullets that we shoot towards reality. Because the biggest enemy ideologies have, is reality. And the interpretation of reality only through ideas and words, inevitably distances, mislead, blind us, and prevents us from actually seeing reality. When the word—let's put an example: ""rapist"" or ""illegal alien""—is fired, the reality of a certain human life, or a community, the whole community is reduced to an idea. And whoever believes or possess and fires that idea, ends up impoverishing, misleading and degrading their perception of reality and the one of everyone around them. But no matter how many tweets to the right or to the left and all our blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, real, true reality will remain unaltered.

 Ten years ago while preparing my film ""Babel"" I had the privilege of getting a glimpse into the reality of hundreds of Mexican and Central American immigrants. Most of them woman, children, and young people, whose lives had been devastated by extreme poverty, domestic violence, hunger, war, rape, and death threats from violent cartels and gangs. Their situation was so desperate that they were willing to become one more among the six thousand immigrants who have died during the last ten years in the desert while seeking for life refuge. Willing to risk their lives and die with their children, rather than returning to their home countries, our countries who have failed, betrayed and abandoned them. Every face, every story, each one of their realities was deeply touching and moving. I don't know how many of the people who will soon decide the future of the eight hundred thousand DACA recipients have had the privilege of meeting one of them in person, looked them in the eyes or listened to their stories. But I am sure that if they do, and see the real reality firsthand, they will understand them. And if they understand them, they will love them. Because as Master Thich Nhat Hanh said: ""Understanding is love's other name. If you don't understand, you can't love.""

 CARNE y ARENA is a humble first attempt at exploring the human condition and expressing and sharing a reality through the birth of a new art. Yes, we are standing in the face of a new art form whose language and visual grammar we are still attempting to understand, and which the new generations will explore and discover, taking it to unimagined places. Our intention from the beginning was to subordinate the technology to the human emotions. To explore one of the oldest themes and conflicts in human history with the newest technology possible. A technology that, depending on how it is used, will separate us, altering, reducing and deforming our perception of reality with only vulgar, profit-driven interest, or will unite us by giving us artistic experiences or, even if only virtually, a slice of our complex reality so that we can understand each other and, therefore, love each other more. Personally, I am not interested in technology to reinvent or escape reality. I am interested in technology as a tool to embrace reality and, like in the immense ocean, submerge myself and discover, transform, appreciate its beauty and great mystery. Today, right here, millions of people seeking refuge are virtually present, although physically invisible. I dedicate and receive this beautiful recognition on behalf of all the immigrants from Mexico, Central America, Asia, Africa, and all corners of the world whose reality has been ignored and held hostage by ideologies and definitions, denying them the possibility of being understood and loved. Thank you very much.

 Thank you so much. This is an amazing honor. Thank you, Academy. To create a single frame of film, as you well know, requires the work of a lot of people, a very hard work. So I want to thank Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira, before anybody else; the amazing cast and crew; Gabriela Rodríguez and Nicolás Celis as producers; Participant and Netflix; Technicolor and Arri.

 If this film was created by my own memories, the film was crafted through the memories of what this great master of cinematography have given to us. It is well known that in Billy Wilder's office there was a sign that said ""What would Lubitsch have done?"" And for me it was: what would Chivo, Chivo Lubezki would have done? So this is for you, too, Chivo. And thank you very much, Mexico. Thank you, my family. And Jonás, Bu y Olmo, love you guys. Thank you.

Our genius director Ryan Coogler, you are a guiding force. Thank you for your trust and understanding my role in telling the African-American story.

 Whoo! Thank you, Laura and Tom. You have not only played a role in some of the most memorable films I've worked on, but you've played a role, literally, in why I love this work and why I have the privilege of being among tonight's honorees, especially my longtime colleagues and friends, Kathy and Frank, and the people in this room. Thank you to my family. To the love of my life, my wife Carol. And Sue, and Doug, and Cindy, Brian, Skylar, and Danny. Thank you, Academy Governors. Like that song in ""Hamilton,"" you were [sings:] in the room where it happens; in the room where it happens.

 I find it hard to believe this is actually happening. This Oscar has been the most surprising and exciting award I can imagine. We've had three presidents of the Academy – Dick Kahn, Sid Ganis, and Cheryl Boone Isaacs – from our own Public Relations Branch. But this is the first time the Academy has considered one of us for this award. So that makes it the most humbling honor, too. It certainly makes me think of all the mentors and bosses who have inspired me along the way. The head of marketing at MGM, Howard Dietz, who wrote lyrics for Broadway and film musicals on MGM letterhead. A lyricist and a publicist, imagine that. And Tex McCrary. He arranged to take over Madison Square Garden for a big rally with twenty thousand people singing and shouting and screaming, ""I like Ike."" He had America's most famous pilot at the time, a woman, Jackie Cochran, and she took the film of the event and flew it to Eisenhower in France to convince him to run for president. And in 1963, along with others, I played a small but personal role in organizing the celebrity activists, from Burt Lancaster, Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, and dozens of others, to go to the March on Washington. When it comes to politics, celebrity is a controversial word right now. But that's what we do. We use celebrity to fight for civil rights. I'm proud to see that passion still shared today.

 I learned a lot from Tex and Howard, particularly that all of this is great, but that it also has to be about showing up for someone. Good; it has to be good. It has to have a purpose. And the person who most taught me about that, more than anyone else, is Steven Spielberg. Yeah, you bet. He's always treated me like a storyteller. And we are all storytellers in the Public Relations Branch. Because the universe we build around our films and our TV isn't just about the story being told, but it's about making sure that the story lasts. Sure, it's about making sure that people come to the theater, but it doesn't stop there. We have to ask, ""Will they be moved by this?"" And sometimes, maybe, they look for something that they missed for the first time, something worth taking a second look at, and maybe learning from it. I like that the description of my work, of our work, is in this branch. Because when Steven created the Shoah Foundation after ""Schindler's List,"" we were doing exactly that. We wanted to make sure the voices and the stories of countless survivors of the genocide, and those who are no longer with us, live on loudly, and last. And it wasn't just in the months and years after the film was released, for generations to come, to lead, to learn the horrors of history. And with the Starlight Children's Foundation – Steven is a Chairman Emeritus. I'm proud to be on the board of directors of something that creates moments of joy and comfort to hospitalized children. Because that, too, is helping children write their own story.

 This Oscar is such an incredible honor. And I know a lot of people wrote in support of me, and I want to say how much that means to me, of course. I remember feeling that way about a letter that, one other time in my life. Actually, it was a recommendation letter Tex had given to me. He wrote, quote, ""Marvin is married to a girl who is as sharp as he is and guarantees that you'll get two brains for the hire of one."" Isn't that terrific? He was right. Carol is still enjoying her own career while I have been enjoying mine. Of course, she always knew what my job entailed, but most friends and relations outside the industry really had no clue. So I never could explain the full range of what the job really entails, but at least now they know I got an Oscar for it. Thank you.

After speaking together for several minutes, Eastwood presents the Oscar to Schifrin and jokingly begins to read Schifrin's speech from the teleprompter. Transcript begins with Schifrin's prepared remarks.]

 LALO SCHIFRIN:
 I am very honored by this distinction that touches me profoundly. My love and appreciation for motion pictures started very early in my life. I remember when I was five years old my parents took me to see a movie, a horror movie, and at that moment I realized that without music it wouldn't be so scary. And it's true. I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to work with great, outstanding directors, producers, and talented musicians in the creation of musical scores to support their projects. Um, so you have any questions? No!

 [Eastwood returns to the podium. The two banter and Eastwood makes several suggestions for additional people to thank based on what he can see on the teleprompter.]

 LALO SCHIFRIN:
 You know, he's jealous because he's afraid that I'm going to compete with him as an actor, and that's why he's doing it. He's sabotaging my speech.

 No, I like to thank my father and my mother, my teachers, my friends, my family, and especially my wife. Composing for movies has given me a lifetime of joy and creativity. Receiving this Honorary Oscar is a culmination of a dream. It is a ""mission accomplished."" Again, my warmest gratitude to all of you for this honor and my personal thanks to Clint and Kathy for their part in this celebration. [Eastwood points to the teleprompter for Schifrin to say the last line of his prepared remarks.] Applause. Oh! Muchas gracias, amigos!

 Thank you. Thank you. Forty-five years ago I was offered a movie entitled ""Sounder."" It was the first major movie that I would have done in my career. On the way to the airport to fly out here I stopped by a very close and longtime dear friend's home to share the news with him. I said, ""I'm going out to Hollywood to do my first big movie."" He looked at me and he said, ""And you're going to be nominated for an Academy Award."" I laughed at him and I said, ""And if I am, you will fly out and you will be my escort."" I was nominated, and he flew out to be my escort. The event was held on his birthday. When I received a call from my agent telling me that he had some good news for me, I assumed that it was going to be that I was to receive an Emmy Award for a segment that I had done on ""How to Get Away with Murder."" I had been nominated four times and so I said, ""Well, I guess they decided they finally are gonna give me one this time."" So, he said, Robert said, ""But he wants to tell you himself."" I said, ""He who?"" ""The president of the Academy."" What Academy? I don't know what he's talking about. He said, ""His name is Mr. Bailey, and I will put him on."" And so Mr. Bailey got on the phone, introduced himself, and said, ""Cicely, it gives me great joy to tell you that yesterday the Board of Governors"" — all 54 or 50 of them — ""decided to give you an Honorary Oscar."" Well, to tell you, I just went to water. I could not say a word, and I have to tell you I don't recall ever receiving any information that sent me into such — I call it Niagara Falls 'cause I couldn't stop. And you can ask Mr. Bailey himself, he'll tell you. I couldn't say a word. All I did was cry. I cried and cried and cried. I said nothing. I don't think I said thank you. Mr. Bailey, where are you? Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance, but I could not.

 In any case, I returned to New York and I went to my friend's home to share this news. He wasn't there and so I called. And I called several times. It's very unlike him to receive a call from me and not respond immediately. And so finally I decided, oh never mind, I'm gonna tell you the story. And I reminded him of what he said to me 45 years ago. I said, ""I want to share something with you. This time I have it. And this time I am asking you to repeat your performance and escort me to California to accept this treasure,"" not realizing that he was ill and that he was in the hospital, and that he never got my message or my invitation for him to escort me to accept this incredible honor. His name was Arthur Mitchell, and he passed two days after that. I know, however, Arthur, wherever you are, that this was what you were promising me, and I want to thank you.

 I want to thank the members of the Academy, the Governors, every single one of you who have made it a point to be here to let me know how much you have supported me all these years. I could not be here if it were not for you. If you had not stood beside me, around me, under me, and made me feel — you know, sometimes when you plan to do something, you hope that it's going to turn out the way you want it to. It doesn't always do that. And so, it just lets me know that you have to have a certain amount of faith and trust and belief in what you do. Quincy said that I said over and over again that I am led by divine guidance. It's when I go against it that I get myself into trouble. That's true.

 Oprah, thank you. I know what it took for you to get here. Whoopi Goldberg, wherever you are, I am and will be eternally grateful to you. Mom, I know you didn't want me to do this, but I did. And here it is. [Holds up the Oscar.] And I know that for the longest time I wanted to hear something positive from her. It took her a long time. And when I did ""Jane Pittman"" I called her up the next day, when I got the recognition, and I said to her, ""Well?"" She said, ""Well, what?"" I said, ""You better tell me something."" And she said, ""I am so proud of you."" And I think that if I had not heard those words from her, none of this would make a difference to me. None of it. Above all, I hope — you know, next month on December 19th I'm going to be 94 years old. And I don't know that I would cherish a better gift than this. This is the culmination of all those years of have and have not. And God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2018,91,2018-11-18,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Matt Damon, Steven Spielberg",Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,and,NA,NA,Kathleen Kennedy Frank Marshall,"FRANK MARSHALL:
 Wow. Wow, what a night. So many friends and family and people we've worked with over the years, I kinda feel like I'm having my bar mitzvah. Or a little bit of a roast from Steven. But, thank you all again for coming tonight. It's just a joyous evening. And thank you, Steven and Matt, for those kind words. And thanks to the Academy. We're really thrilled to be here tonight. And we'd like to also congratulate Cicely Tyson, Lalo Schifrin and Marvin Levy on their Oscars. And one special shout-out for our dear friend Marvin. Marvin, happy birthday! Yeah, there you are.

 Because we are the first couple to receive this honor, I guess it's only fitting that I began my career in movies working for another creative couple, Peter Bogdanovich and Polly Platt. I had met them at a party in 1966 for John Ford's daughter, Barbara, who was a film editor and was married to Ken Curtis, one of Ford's repertory of actors, and a good friend of my parents. Peter and Polly were in town doing a documentary on Mr. Ford, and Peter was very excited that night because a producer named Roger Corman had just offered him his first directing job. It wasn't going to happen right away because they still had no script and they'd have to write it, and then they would do that back in New York.

 Now, despite the fact I was majoring in political science at UCLA, as everyone was back then, and despite the fact I knew nothing about movies, I offered to help Peter and Polly if they ever came back. And sure enough, about three months later my dad called and said, ""Did you meet a guy named Bogslonovich or something at the Ford party?"" And I said, ""Yes. Why?"" ""He wants you to call him."" For those under thirty, that was how social media worked back then. Someone would call your dad on a landline, leave a message, he would write it down, and a couple of weeks later he might remember to tell you to call that person back. So I called Peter back and he said he and Polly were going to make this movie called ""Targets,"" and would I be interested in working on it? I said, ""Can I start in an hour?"" And then I asked, ""Well, what would you want me to do?"" He answered, ""I don't know, I've never made a movie before. Just come over."" So I did. And without knowing it, I began to learn the skills that a producer needs to solve problems. And I began to understand the challenges in helping the director get their vision up on the screen.

 And this could not have been a better starting point for me in becoming a creative producer. Because with Peter as the director and Polly as the production designer, I got to see and solve problems from the creative side. ""Targets"" was an on-the-job film school and the best introduction to filmmaking one could ever have. I watched Peter block and set up shots, and how brilliantly he worked with the actors. And I learned from Polly how a producer should be hands-on in paying attention to detail. And these first on-the-job lessons I got from them have stayed with me to this day. Now I know you're wondering about that political science degree. Well, I did graduate from UCLA and was on my way to law school when I realized I had fallen in love with the process of making movies. Luckily, Peter rescued me from what might have been a very unhappy legal career when he called again and asked me to come to Texas for ""The Last Picture Show."" I immediately accepted the job of location manager, and that soon led to being promoted to associate producer on ""Paper Moon.""

 For the rest of the 70's I was lucky to do several more pictures with Peter and three other visionary directors: Walter Hill — one of them [pointing to him in the audience] — and a couple of other guys named Orson Welles and Martin Scorsese, but they're not here tonight. And I was also lucky to be mentored by legendary producers Larry Gordon — who's here tonight — Irwin Winkler and George Lucas. And on the personal side, I was single and happily married to the movies that I was making. And then in 1979, Steven changed all that when he hired Kathy to be his secretary/assistant on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" I never dreamed I would meet someone who loved making movies as much as I did, but working with Steven, Kathy and I became friends and collaborators, and eventually we became an actual family.

 Thank you all again for this wonderful honor and celebration, and thanks to all the producers and directors who have given us this opportunity to take this joyful journey together and pursue the passion we love, making movies and telling stories. And in particular, thank you to Peter Bogdanovich for his trust and loyalty in me. We're still working together half a century later after he took a chance on me. And how fitting is it for us to have just produced our 10th picture together, the completion of Orson Welles's final film, ""The Other Side of the Wind."" And now I'm going to pass the baton to my partner in movies and in life, Kathleen Kennedy.


 KATHLEEN KENNEDY:
 I'm not sure I'm gonna recover from the ""couch"" story; I'm just starting there. Well, I have to say it's pretty amazing to be standing here, obviously, with Frank, and Steven, and realizing that we now join the company of so many greats that have received this award in the past. Filmmakers such as William Wyler, Jack Warner, Steven, Francis Coppola, Alfred Hitchcock, George Lucas — legends all. And both of us are very proud that you find us worthy to be honored as part of this Hollywood legacy. It also means a lot to have both Matt and Steven here to present the award to us — I don't know what happened to Matt, but I think he's still here. And we're very honored to share the Thalberg Award as the first married couple. I'm also very proud to be the first woman to accept this award. But I'm also not the first to deserve it, and I'm a hundred percent sure I'm not the last!

 I've always loved the movies and I've been enthralled by the power of story. Steven said this when he accepted the award 30 years ago. That power begins with the written word. I feel extraordinarily lucky to have worked with some of the best screenwriters and directors in the business, and also to have witnessed so many advances in technology to help tell those stories. But those advances are only made powerful and emotional in their support of storytelling. That blueprint, those words, set everything in motion. And without great writing, we have nothing to produce.

 When I began working with Steven, he handed me a script for his next film. He said, ""Read this, it's my next movie. But don't tell anybody anything."" And that directive is pretty much what he tells you every time he hands you anything. That script was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" written by Lawrence Kasdan, and remains today one of the best scripts I've ever read. When I finished reading the script, Steven was waiting expectantly to hear what I thought. I said, ""It's great, but how are we gonna make this?"" And he said, ""Call producer Frank Marshall."" So I called Mr. Marshall. I called him ""Mr. Marshall"" repeatedly until he said, ""Could you please stop calling me that. I'm Frank."" He then offered to come over to our offices and introduce himself. I was expecting this much older man, maybe mid-50's. But in walked this handsome young guy, and I have to admit, my first reaction was,""helloooo, Mr. Marshall!"" So after some back and forth I told Frank that Steven asked me to build some models of the truck chase in ""Raiders,"" but I confessed I hadn't done much model building. Frank was immediately excited and agreed to help me. He loved building models. So, to quote Humphrey Bogart's line to Claude Rains in ""Casablanca,"" it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

 That friendship is now actually in its 32nd year of marriage and 40 years of collaboration. And I'm so grateful to share a career and a home with someone whose character and convictions, his decency and humor, are in evidence every day. And as proud as we are of our movies, we have two wonderful daughters who are the heart and soul of our lives, Lili and Meghan. And when they were little we would throw them into backpacks and carry them through the redwoods while making ""Jurassic Park,"" or sometimes we would create school rooms on the set of ""Indiana Jones."" And during our time away we have worked tirelessly, in tandem, to watch them grow and to make sure that their lives are defined by creativity, quality, and, most of all, kindness. These are the same values we bring to our filmmaking and the same values the Thalberg Award must always continue to represent. I've been fortunate to have had the chance to work with extraordinary people to help reinforce those ideals: my mother, my father, Frank, and of course, Steven. Steven, Frank and I formed Amblin Entertainment in 1981 with a goal that I think would make Mr. Thalberg proud: to tell hopeful stories, stories about triumph of the human spirit and the ability to rise above circumstance. And even with all the exciting changes happening within film and motion pictures, with all the tools being invented that help us tell those stories, those fundamental values that I look for and strive for, will never change.

 But we all know there are changes in our industry that should be embraced, ones that must be embraced. For as our industry grows and changes, who gets to tell their stories needs to grow and change as well. I know firsthand how allowing new voices at the table can change someone's life. My opportunity to work in television was the result of a lawsuit back in 1973 filed against a station because women did not occupy any technical jobs. That lawsuit opened a door for me, and it is just one reason why I so passionately believe that each of us has the obligation to ensure that everyone who has a story to tell be given the opportunity that I, and many of you in this room, had. And it is my hope that with this inclusion of these powerful new voices, we might just bring the world back to its senses, just, and maybe, just maybe, shatter a few glass ceilings along the way.

 So tonight, to end this, I just want to say we are profoundly grateful to be here tonight with all of you. And, I mean, it's just incredible that Oprah is here. And Quincy is here. And we worked with Marvin Levy. And Steven's here. And it feels like some kind of amazing reunion that I can't quite believe the stars lined up in quite the way they did. But there's nothing that's more important than to be able to experience something like this with people that you genuinely care about and have been a part of your life for a long time. So this is an incredible honor and a privilege. And we thank you.

 God, I'm full of so much gratitude right now. And I do not feel elevated above any of my fellow nominees, or anyone in this room, because we share the same love, the love of film. And this form of expression has given me the most extraordinary life. I don't know what I'd be without it. But I think the greatest gift that it's given me, and many of us in this room, is the opportunity to use our voice for the voiceless. I've been thinking a lot about some of the distressing issues that we are facing collectively. And I think at times we feel, or were made to feel, that we champion different causes. But for me, I see commonality. I think, whether we're talking about gender inequality, or racism, or queer rights, or indigenous rights, or animal rights, we're talking about the fight against injustice. We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender, or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.

 I think that we've become very disconnected from the natural world. And many of us, what we're guilty of is an egocentric worldview, the belief that we're the center of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth we steal her baby even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. And then we take her milk that's intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. And I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up. But human beings at our best are so inventive and creative and ingenious, and I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.

 Now I have been, I have been a scoundrel in my life. I have been selfish. I have been cruel at times, hard to work with, and ungrateful, but so many of you in this room have given me a second chance. And I think that's when we're at our best. When we support each other. Not when we cancel each other out for past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow. When we educate each other. When we guide each other toward redemption. That is the best of humanity. When he was 17, my brother wrote this lyric, he said: Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow. Thank you.

 Wow. Thank you. This is incredible, really incredible. Thank you to the Academy for this honor of honors. They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week. I'm thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it; in the end the adults do the right thing.

 This [holding up the Oscar] really is about Quentin Jerome Tarantino. You are original. You are one of a kind. The film industry would be a much drier place without you.

I'm not one to look back but this has made me do so. And I think of my folks taking me to the drive-in to see ""Butch and Sundance,"" and loading up my car and moving out here, and Geena and Ridley giving me my first shot, to all the wonderful people I've met along way to stand here now. Once upon a time in Hollywood, ain't that the truth? This is for my kids who color everything I do; I adore you. Thank you.

 David Livingstone, Cameron McCracken, director Rupert Goold, boy, it was a privilege to work with you and I feel so proud to be in your beautiful movie. I gotta thank my stage moms: Matt, Anna, Geoff and Eric Vetro, Paul, Gary.

Big brother Drew, Brandy, Judy, Stone and Ava, for all the love, all the love and support possible that makes you believe anything is possible.

 And I have to say that this past year of conversations celebrating Judy Garland across genders and – I'm sorry – across generations and across cultures has been a really cool reminder that our heroes unite us. You know, the best among us who inspire us to find the best in ourselves. You know, when they unite us, when we look to our heroes, we agree. And that matters. Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, Delores Huerta, Venus and Serena, and Selena, Bob Dylan, Scorsese, Fred Rogers, Harriet Tubman. We agree on our teachers and we agree on our courageous men and women in uniform who serve. We agree on our first responders and firefighters. And when we celebrate our heroes we're reminded of who we are as one people, united. And though Judy Garland did not receive this honor in her time, I am certain that this moment is an extension of the celebration of her legacy that began on our film set. And is also representative of the fact that her legacy of unique exceptionalism and inclusivity and generosity of spirit, it transcends any one artistic achievement. Miss Garland, you were certainly among the heroes who unite and define us, and this is certainly for you. I am so grateful. Thank you so much, everybody. Good night.

 Oh my god. Frank Capra – you guys remember – Frank Capra handed me a Student Academy Award in 1977. And I thought I had skipped the hard part; I thought I would then go on to make movies. And if I hadn't had that encouragement at my back back then, I wouldn't have been able to withstand the last four decades in this business. I want to thank A&E IndieFilms and Molly Thompson, Grain Media. To Adam Mitchenall, the man behind the women. The brilliants, my Lisa Rinzler, cinematographer, and Mary Manhardt, editor extraordinaire. To Zama and Tam Ayzai, our number one girl crew. I've been working in Afghanistan since 2005, and this movie is my love letter to the brave girls of that country. To get to Capra from here took a whole lot of not quitting, and teachers – the kind I strive to be at NYU Film School and the kind of teachers at Skateistan, the school at the heart of the film. They teach girls courage, to raise your hand, to say: I am here. I have something to say. And I'm gonna take that ramp, don't try to stop me. Thank you very much.

 ELENA ANDREICHEVA:
 Thank you. Keep Skateistan rolling.

 Thank you so much to the Academy and everybody out there that supported this film. There were lots of you. We share this award with you. There were so many filmmakers that worked so hard on this, and it was a labor of love. And it was because we have a firm belief that representation matters deeply, especially in cartoons. Because in cartoons that's when we first see our movies, and it's how we shape our lives and think about how we see the world. So I want to thank Sony Pictures Animation, who were the progressive people that believed in us from the beginning: Kristine Belson, Jeff Korchek. Thank you to Lion Forge Animation, to Six Point Harness and to Matthew Cherry. Thank you to my beautiful husband, my son[s] Chase and Miles, for believing in me. Thank you so much.

 MATTHEW A. CHERRY:
 So we have a big team that we have to thank but time is running short, so I just want to say that ""Hair Love"" was done because we wanted to see more representation in animation. We wanted to normalize black hair. There's a very important issue that's out there; it's the Crown Act. And if we can help to get this passed in all 50 states it will help stories like DeAndre Arnold's, who's our special guest tonight, stop to happen. This award is dedicated to Kobe Bryant.

She always had a story about some crazy thing that happened with her siblings when she was growing up, or some weird dog that she had seen, or something that the taxi driver had told her about his life that would break your heart. And I learned from watching her that a well-told story is, it's a powerful thing. And it can change the way we see the world. And it can help us to notice other people and care about those other people and maybe love each other a little bit more. So this is for her and for all the storytellers. Thank you.

 God, I'm amazing! The way these people will tell it I am absolutely amazing. Thank you so much, Christian. I'd simply like to say: it's about time. Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time. It's about space. It's about a lot of people in the strangest of place. From the rolling hills, the plains of North America, to the mountains of Appalachia. From the desert beauty of Navajo Diné Nation to the gritty streets of Los Angeles, and the sound stages of Hollywood where wearing motion picture wardrobe. It's been a wild and wonderful ride.

 And I'm really proud to be here tonight as the first indigenous Native American to receive an Academy Award for a body of work. And I won't say how long it's taken me to do this. I can only say that the journey has been peopled by many. From grips and electricians, to focus pullers on camera crews, and lighting experts, transpo, makeup, wardrobe, effects, greens, set decorators and construction workers working alongside actors, directors, background people and producers. And yes, studios, with their ever-important business offices. With whom I must say I have the most wonderful and efficient team of managers and agents in the persons of Alexa Pagonas, Michael Black from Michael Black Management, Melisa Spamer from Domain agency. And they relieve me of the process of ""making the deal"" now. So, yeah, yeah, I can still be available. Yeah.

 Now, my many thanks that I offer tonight are heartfelt, sincere. To the Governors of the Academy, and especially former governor Gregory Nava, and his beautiful wife Barbara, for nominating me in the first place and explaining to me the intricacies and the meaning of this particular award. It's a total and humbling honor to receive an award for doing something I love to do and, comparatively speaking, started late in life. But hey, who's countin', right? I've been blessed, really blessed, by support for my efforts on many fronts. From my parents, Maggie – who you saw – and the late Andy Studi of Collinsville, Oklahoma. Two of my children, Leah and Kholan, who are here with us tonight. To Maura Dhu Studi, my partner and wife of 30-plus years, who, just a bit unlike my parents who did blink a bit once or twice whenever I told them my decision to move out to L.A. to become an actor, Maura has always had the ""why not?"" attitude and that ""let's just do it!"" kind of philosophy of getting down to work and planning the next step of furthering a career and finding the next job. Or creating your own work, whether in film, stage, TV – hey, you know, I mean, an actor's gotta keep workin', right?

 Now, I was fortunate to have come to Hollywood at a time when Native Americans were a subject of interest in the film business. You know, it comes and goes. From my commercial film debut in the one indie film called ""Powwow Highway"" [shout-out from audience]. Hey, okay, got a stir. And it starred Gary Farmer, my good friend, and was directed by my Santa Fe neighbor Jonathan Wacks. To my most recent stint in front of the camera for the film ""Hostiles,"" starring Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, Q'orianka Kilcher and myself. It was directed by Scott Cooper and produced by John Lesher – I had hoped I would see them tonight, but well... But I'm forever grateful for the many casting directors I've worked with over the years because, you know, without them actually directing the process of casting, I don't think I would be here in front of you tonight. And I thank you all; I thank you very much for your work.

 ""Dances With Wolves"" was, and is, probably the film that got me started in the business. Luckily there was a character with no actual name, known only as ""the toughest Pawnee,"" was noticed by audiences and filmmakers alike. And I believe the Pawnee even appreciated it. And for that I have, of course, Kevin Costner to thank for that. And I thank you, Kevin. And I am especially honored tonight to have at my table Michael Mann. Michael directed me in two of his many films, both ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Heat."" Milestones. Milestones in my career. One as, you know, the angry Magua of ""Last of the Mohicans,"" and a character called Casals of ""Heat."" Casals allowed me to go beyond the leather and feathers of period drama to an ethnic non-specific role played out in the dark underbelly of contemporary society – was that a mouthful or what? Thank you, Michael. Thank you very much. We should do another one, after you get finished with that one. Now, another two-time hitter for me was the incomparable director Walter Hill, who took a chance – Walter Hill. Walter took a chance on an unknown, practical unknown, to play the title role of Geronimo among a huge cast of A-list actors, the likes of Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall. And Walter also, we shot a film, a boxing film, in prison. And I also considered this role kind of ethnically non-specific as well. ""Undisputed"" was a hoot to shoot in prison. So I thank Walter for that.

 So like, these guys that I just named are the guys who more or less made me. You know? But the thing about it is, while I thank everyone for all of these things, I of course have to say that I put in some effort as well. I was... in any case I started working a lot after these films. They afforded me the opportunity to find work in subsequent films, like the highest box office movie of its time, ""Avatar."" You heard of it? It was created and directed by James Cameron and produced by Jon Landau. And I thank those guys. Now while I've had, you know, good luck to be in blockbuster movies, important films over the years, I'm just as proud, if not more, to have worked with writers, directors and producers of many independent films that have gone on to, like, really have legs of their own. And working, I also worked in the fast-developing Native American sphere of filmmaking with director/producer Georgina Lightning with her film ""Older than America,"" and with director Chris Eyre for his film ""Edge of America"" – I guess we kind of had this thing about America. And while I refuse to call ""The Only Good Indian"" my personal favorite, I will call it my favorite film directed by Kevin Willmott of ""BlacKkKlansman"" fame. I thank you Georgina, Chris, and Kevin. We should make some more.

 So in closing, I'd like to thank each and every actor I have ever worked with, whether you liked me or not. From my very first paying gig at American Indian Theatre Company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the recently – thank you – to the recently completed western, called ""Badlands,"" set to open November 1. And last, but certainly not the least, I want a big shout-out to the fans and followers on social media that, and moviegoers, that make all of this possible for us. [Speaks in Cherokee (English translation)]: ""Thank you is what we say as Cherokee. Those of you who are here, thank you. You Cherokee who are here, I'm grateful. I'm grateful. Thank you to the soldiers and veterans also.""

2019,92,2019-10-27,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Tom Hanks, Constance Wu",Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Geena Davis,"GEENA DAVIS:
 Thank you. Thank you, Constance. Thank you, Tom. Thank you very much. I sound great when they talk about me. So, my sincere thanks to the Governors for this incredible honor. I'm very, very grateful. And I promise I won't let it go to my head. Because I think I'm pretty much the same, you know, small-town, goofy gal that I always was. It's so funny because I was just talking about this with the driver in the motorcade on the way over here... It's funny.

 So, one day several months ago I was shocked to get a flurry of texts telling me that I needed to call John Bailey, immediately! So I got a little worried that perhaps I had committed some Academy crime. But to find out that it was about this, it was really wonderful. I love being part of our industry, and I have so much passion for acting. It's my joy in life. And I've also been passionate about empowering women, as you heard, and girls, in part by seeking roles that I think might resonate with them in some way. In fact, I have only played role models... What!? Oh, all right, so I was in a movie called ""Earth Girls Are Easy."" This was very early on. If we put that one title aside you can take me seriously.

 The film that actually changed my life was ""Thelma & Louise."" Yeah, it really did. And it made me realize in a very powerful way how few opportunities we give women to come out of a movie feeling excited and empowered by the female characters. And this led me to have a very profound interest in the way girls and women are depicted in the world. So years later, when my daughter Alizeh was a toddler, that spidey sense led me to notice that there seemed to be far more male characters than female characters in media made for young kids. Really!? I thought surely by now we should be showing kids that boys and girls share the sandbox equally. But when I started talking to content creators about it, to a person they said, ""Oh no, no, no. That's been fixed."" And they felt a responsibility – they were serious – they felt a responsibility to do right by girls and they thought they were. So how could that be? How could the people creating content not be aware of how bereft of female presence their creations were?

 So now I realized I needed the data. And it turns out that the message that we are sending is that men and boys are far more valuable to us than women and girls. Here's just one small example. If you look at the occupations of characters in film, 81 percent of the characters with jobs are male. And the number of women in top professions are profoundly under-represented, even compared to the low, real-life stats. So in other words, however abysmal the numbers are in real life, it's far worse in fiction – where you make it up! It can be anything you want and we make it worse than the crappy reality. But people characterize us Hollywood-types as bleeding-heart liberals, LGBTQ and diversity champions, and all that – hardly. If we are supposed to be a bunch of gender-fluid, intersectional feminists, then by god let's do it up right! Let's live up to our label! Live up to our stereotype. Do we really want to stand by the idea that it's fine for female characters to be one-dimensional, narrowly stereotyped, hyper-sexualized, or simply not there at all?

 So this is why I chose to focus on what kids see first. It's just common sense: Don't create a problem that you have to try to solve later on. Think about how dramatically different our world would be if we hadn't all grown up with these unconscious biases. And I also want to be clear, I'm not talking about making the lead character a female. Don't come away thinking, ""Hey, you know, maybe some day I'll consider making a female-led film."" What I'm saying is, whatever you're working on right now, everything that you're working on right now, boost the female population. And one of the quickest ways, in my opinion, to reach gender parity is to go through a script that you're already gonna make and cross out a bunch of first names of ensemble characters and supporting characters and make them female. And with one stroke you have created some non-stereotyped characters that might turn out to be even more interesting now that they've had a gender swap. [Audience member yells out a ""Whoo!""] Right. Thank you. It's simple. It's fun. It's simple. And then – cast me! Seriously. Seriously. I mean, humanitarian, yay! Yes! Ha ha, ha ha! [Picks up the Oscar, then sets it down immediately.] But here's the thing... is there a reason it can't also benefit me personally? Let's go.

 So, here's my theory of change. Nearly every sector of our society has a huge gender-disparity problem. But there's one category of gross gender inequality where the under-representation of women can be fixed absolutely overnight: on screen. Let's make this change happen right now. Tomorrow morning, look at the projects you're working on and do a gender and diversity pass. Don't make one more movie without doing that first. Tape a sign to your office wall that says: No more missed opportunities. Let's do this, okay? Thank you very much.

Like, thank you for your light. He was on this earth for 21 years, 21 years, and he found a way to feed kids breakfast, educate kids, give free medical care, against all the odds. He showed, he showed me, he taught me – him, Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, the Black Panther Party – they showed me how to love myself. And with that love they overflowed it to the Black community and to other communities. And they showed us that the power of union, the power of unity, that when they play divide and conquer, we say unite and ascend. Thank you so much for showing me myself. And yeah, man, there's so much work to do, guys. And that's on everyone in this room. This ain't no single-man job. That's some [unintelligible]. And I look to everyone, every single one of you.

As you know, I'm from Korea and actually my name is Yuh-Jung Youn and most of European people call me [pronounced] Yuh-Yung and some of them call me [pronounced] Yoo-Jung. But tonight, you are all forgiven. And well, I would usually when I'm living in the other part of the world, I just watch the television. It is the Oscar, but, event on the television, just watching, like a television program for us. But me being here by myself, this I cannot believe. I'm here. Okay, let me pull myself together.

 Thank you for the tremendous thanks to the Academy members who vote for me. And next [in the] speech, okay, they usually say, okay, thank you for the [laughs]... wonderful ""Minari"" family. Steven, Isaac, Yeri, and Noel, Alan. We became a family. And most of all, above all, Lee Isaac Chung. Without him I couldn't be here tonight. He was our captain and my director. So thanks to you.

 And I like to thank to – well, see, I don't believing in competition. How can I win Glenn Close, win over Glenn Close? I've been watching her so many performances. So, this is just, all the nominee, five nominees, we are the winner for the different movie, different role. We played the different role. So we cannot compete each other. Tonight I'm here. It's just I have just little bit luck, I think, maybe. I'm luckier than you. And also, maybe, is American hospitality for the Korean actor? I'm not sure. But anyway, thank you so much. And I like to thank to my two boys, who made me go out and work. Beloved sons, Eol and Nuel, this is the result [holds up the Oscar] because Mommy work so hard. And I like to dedicate this award for my first director, Kim Ki-young, who was very genius director. I made the movie together with him, first movie.

 Wow, okay, I've been nominated to speak on behalf of Dana and Kemp Powers, our co-director. This film started as a love letter to jazz, but we had no idea how much jazz would teach us about life. Like we don't get to control what happens but we can, like a jazz musician, turn whatever happens into something of value and something of beauty. And that was certainly true of our amazing cast. Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, you guys are amazing. Our brilliant collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Jon Batiste, this guy over there [pointing to Questlove], it was just fantastic working with all you guys. Our cultural consultants, Dr. Johnnetta Cole, people who kept us honest and keep those characters truthful. We're really thankful to our partners at Disney who, when we said: Hey, we want to do a film that explores the purpose of life. They're like: Okay, go ahead. That's not your usual cartoon fare. And of course, to our family. Dana wants to thank…

 DANA MURRAY:
 My amazing husband, my parents, I'm here because of you. I love you so much. Hazel and Murray, my babies at home, you're everything to me. We obviously have to think of the crew who made this film and even finished it from home with seven weeks of production left. You are, you should be up here with us, and we are just the lucky speakers. I'm not supposed to be speaking actually.

 PETE DOCTER:
 So our main character, Joe, is a music teacher. We want to thank music teachers and art teachers everywhere. You – including my parents Dave and Rita and Dana's parents Pam and Tom – you make the world a better place. And my wish for all of us tonight is that we could follow the example of jazz musicians, that, wherever we are, whatever we have, we turn it into something beautiful. Thank you.

 Oh, man. Thank you. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to my brilliant, brilliant nominees, fellow nominees, thank you. My entire ""Nomadland"" company, what a crazy once-in-a-lifetime journey we went on together. Thank you so much. I'm so grateful to you.

 I've been thinking a lot lately of how I keep going when things get hard. And I think, I think it goes back to something I learned when I was a kid. When I was growing up in China my dad and I used to play this game. We would memorize classic Chinese poems and texts, and we would recite it together and try to finish each other's sentences. And there's one that I remember so dearly. It's called the ""Three Character Classics."" And the first phrase goes: rén zhi chu, xìng ben shàn. ""People at birth are inherently good."" And those six letters had such a great impact on me when I was a kid, and I still truly believe them today. Even though sometimes it might seem like the opposite is true, but I have always found goodness in the people I've met, everywhere I went in the world. So this [holding up the Oscar] is for anyone who has the faith and the courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves, and to hold on to the goodness in each other, no matter how difficult it is to do that. And this is for you. You inspire me to keep going. Thank you. Thank you.

 Thank you to the Academy. And thank you to all of our incredible nominees who spent so many years and, I presume, a lot of tears making beautiful and important films and bringing them into the world. I'd like to thank Craig Foster and his family, especially Tom and Swati, who opened their hearts and supported us every step of the way, and fed us and allowed their home to become a production company for three years. I want to thank our production partners at Off the Fence, especially Ellen Windemuth and Sam Barton-Humphreys, who believed in this film before it was anything. We want to thank Netflix for enabling us to share our story with the world. And then our incredible ""Octopus"" team, whose arms stretch across the planet from South Africa to Amsterdam to the U.K. to the U.S. Roger and Warren, for beautiful cinematography. Dan and Jinx, for incredible patience and editing. Kevin and Barry and Kyle and all the people at the Refinery. And the incredible Sea Change Project, who's been in the background supporting us the whole way along and caring so much for the Great African Seaforest, which is where the octopus lived. And our friends and family, who put up with years and years of tunnel vision. In many – and I know there are many South Africans who are awake in the middle of the night to watch this ceremony. And in many ways this really is a tiny, personal story that played out in a sea forest at the very tip of Africa. But on a more universal level, I hope that it provided a glimpse of a different kind of relationship between human beings and the natural world.

 JAMES REED:
 And I don't have a lot to add to that. Pippa covered it very well. And it's a great and totally overwhelming honor to be here and so thank you so much to the Academy. And all the incredible films that were in our category, it's really humbling and amazing. And I'd also like to thank my family: Rosie and Isabel*, and my mum and my two sisters, Jenny* and Janice. I don't think I'd be here today without their sort of level of love and support, so thank you very much. And I think the final extra thank you for Craig, who, while it was such an enormous team making this film in the end, it sort of began and ended with him and it's his story. And he kind of showed us that, you know, if a man can kind of form a friendship with an octopus it does sort of make you wonder what else is possible. So thank you, Craig. And cheers, everyone.

 Thank you to the Academy. I hope the actors in the room don't mind that I have something written down here because there're all different kinds of people in the Academy. Today's Colette's birthday. She was born just 22 days before the very first Oscars in 1929. So I imagine it must have been a, probably about a crowd about this big, right? You know? When she, when we got nominated she told us that, or she reminded us, that the power of documentary filmmaking ensured that her brother Jean-Pierre was, as she put it, no longer lost in the night and fog of the Nazi concentration camp system. And I want to say that I think it's that same power of the documentary storytelling that is going to ensure that the memory, courage and resilience of Latasha Harlins, Horace Bowers, the innocent children of Yemen and the protesters in Hong Kong are not forgotten. I mean, that's why we do this. That's why we make these films, so thank you. Thank you. We're grateful that these stories and these individuals have been honored tonight. And I also would just like to thank, of course, Colette et Lucie. I want to thank our amazing EP Peter Hirschmann at Electronic Arts. Everyone at Electronic Arts and Respawn and Oculus, especially Vince, Dusty and Laura. And our producers Annie Small and Aaron Matthews, thank you so much. To the Guardians, Charlie Phillips, Jess Gormley and Lindsay Poulton, we share this award with you.

 And I just add something. This award is a tribute and this film is a tribute to woman everywhere in the world, of any ages, who are joining hands and fight for justice. Vive Colette et vive la France.

Since I was five or something, I've been preparing speeches – in train stations, at school, in the toilet. And here I am. It's real. It's amazing. Wow.

 This is a film about letting go of control in life, as I lost control in my own. And I want to thank my wife Helene, who sits over here, for being the angel of this project, for guiding me through this very difficult period. I want to thank my children, my family: Nanna, Ida, Albert, Lily. My screenwriter Tobias Lindholm, who's my guardian angel in both living and writing, I'm sending you my praises. There's a lot of people to thank but I'll, I'll get there. I'm sending my praises to Zentropa, Sisse, Kasper, Peter, Feder, Kornum, all of you. You had so much heart, so much strength at the same time. The crew, who threw everything they had in their hands to rescue me, and rescued this film. The investors, my agents, distributors. Samuel Goldwyn, Bart Walker, all of you, Christina Bazdekis, Jessica Sykes, Bumble. You're all there. Cinetic, thank you for showing the bravery of investing in a movie that is about four depraved white drunk men, basically. Who teaches children to drink, as well. I mean, pretty uphills in my perspective. Those four white men being Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe, Thomas Bo Larsen, my old friend – the whole cast, you were brilliant. Susse, Maria, all of you, took out your hearts for this and were brilliant. I want to send a special thank, of course, to Mads Mikkelsen, [exclaims!], Mads Mikkelsen. Yeah, give him a hand. Mads, you gave us your finest. Not just for the film, but for my daughter as well. And I'll never forget.

 Okay, so we wanted to make a film that celebrates life, and four days into shooting the impossible happens. An accident on a highway took my daughter away. Someone looking into his cell phone. And we miss her and I love her. And… sorry. Two months before we shot this movie and two months before she died, she was in Africa. She sent me a letter. And she'd just read the script and she was glowing with excitement. She loved this. And she felt seen by this. And she was supposed to be in this. And if anyone dares to believe that she's here with us somehow, she – you'll be able to see her clapping and cheering with us. We ended up making this movie for her, as her monument. So, Ida, this is a miracle that just happened. And you're a part of this miracle. Maybe you've been pulling some strings somewhere, I don't know, but this one is for you. Thank you very much.

And whoever enjoys it receives a charge of energy, something pulsing, mysterious and vibrant. ""Sound of Metal,"" I received from its team so much care, love and attention, so much energy, that we believe it's one of the reasons why the film has been received by the audience so beautifully. So thank you for that. Thank you very much.

 Well, all my colleagues are overseas. Unfortunately for them they have to let me speak, so this is what you get. It's amazing, amazing. Our visual effects team on ""Tenet,"" we did so many things and there's so many departments we have to thank. Not just in our own but in, you know, the art department and Nathan, and camera department, Hoyte. And of course, our stunt coordinator George Cottle, who's amazing. But it all goes back to our director Christopher Nolan. He leads us all and gives us amazing opportunities to do amazing things. And I'd like to thank my family, my wife, my amazing crew. And my father, who won this same award. Thank you.

 Thank you. Thank you so much. It's such a great joy and such a great honor, and I share these joys and this award with Sir Christopher Hampton. We have worked together for years and I want to thank him for being such a great writer and such a wonderful friend. And I have to thank everyone involved in ""The Father"" and everyone who helped me to make that film, that script becoming a film. My producers, of course: Simon Friend, who first produced the play in London; the great David Parfitt; Philippe Carcassone; Jean-Louis Livi; Christophe Spadone. The Sony Classics family: Michael, Tom, Melody. All my team at CAA: Bryan – sorry, so many names that I have to mention – Federica, Chris, Andrew, Laurent, Olivier and Suzanne, thank you for being so supportive.

 And the crew of ""The Father,"" of course, and the wonderful cast: Olivia Williams, Olivia Colman, Rufus Sewell, Mark Gatiss, Imogen Poots, and of course, Anthony Hopkins. I wrote the script for him. To me, he's the greatest, the greatest living actor. And just the idea to work with him was like a dream. And I knew that it was not an easy dream to fulfill because I'm French, as you can hear. It was my first feature film, and you know, he's Sir Anthony Hopkins. But I thought, until someone comes and proves that it was not possible, it means that potentially it is. And sometimes we are the one who close the door of what is possible and what is not possible. And for ""The Father,"" I really wanted not to close that door and to follow my inspiration, my desire and my dream. So thank you, Anthony, for having said yes to that script and thank you for having given everything to that film – your energy, your grace and your talent. Sharing that journey with you was the most amazing experience of my life. And at last, I want to thank my wife Marine for supporting me with love and patience. Thank you to the Academy.

 Oh my gosh. They said write a speech and I didn't 'cause I just didn't think this would ever happen. And I'm going to be in trouble with Steven Soderbergh. I'm so sorry. I don't want him to be cross with me. Oh my god, he's so heavy [referring to the Oscar statuette], and he's so cold! I better lay him down. So the only speech I ever wrote was when I was ten. And I had a look to see if there'd be anything useful from it, but unfortunately it mostly thanked Zack Morris from ""Saved by the Bell,"" who was my very supportive husband. Unfortunately, he hasn't been as much a part of my life as I'd hoped, and so that speech is not that useful.

 But all I can say is – I'm trying very hard not to cry, which is very difficult as an English person because you don't cry ever. This film was made by the most incredible people in the world, who made it in 23 days, just, and brought their complete genius and love and humor to it. And I have so many people to thank. I feel mortified that I'm here by myself when it's not just my job at all. I want to thank Carey Mulligan for being not only the most talented person in the world, but the kindest and the funniest. I want to thank the producers for standing behind this film always and, you know, never giving up. And LuckyChap, Focus, FilmNation. The cast and the crew, the greatest in the world, the kindest in the world. They just made me look good, and again, I'm just so grateful. Finally, my family: Mum, Dad, Coco, my husband Chris – come on, come on – our son, who did not arrive until a couple of weeks after shooting. Thank god, because I was crossing my legs the whole way through. So thank you all so much. Steven, I hope that was alright. Thank you.

 Bryan, thank you for those kind words. They mean so much to us coming from a member of our MPTF family. Jennifer, Norma and I want to express our gratitude to David Rubin, Dawn Hudson, and the Academy Board of Governors for recognizing the Motion Picture & Television Fund tonight with this very special honor, especially since this is the first time the award has gone to an organization. Thank you to our boards who have guided us and supported us over the years, your kind words during the pandemic were cherished. Much appreciation to the thousands of small and large donors who sustain our charity and to our volunteers whose contribution of their personal time is so essential to our mission.

 Here's to the tens of thousands of freelance workers in our entertainment community, those in front of and behind the camera. They are the heartbeat of our industry and for a hundred years MPTF has been their safety net of support. This year alone MPTF connected with our industry workforce over 40,000 times. Thank you to the residents of the iconic Motion Picture Home. They've had a very rough twelve months of social isolation. Tonight, though, they are all together – but socially distanced – and watching the Oscars.

 To Norma Carranza, nurse, and to Jennifer Jorge, social worker, both of whom exemplify the best in their fields, and to the rest of our MPTF work family on the front line during the pandemic, the social workers and nurses, doctors and housekeepers, activities staff and food servers, accountants, fundraisers, IT techs, producers, HR professionals, chaplains, cooks and landscapers – they are our industry superheroes of 2020. This award is for them and the tens of thousands of others who have worked at MPTF over the past 100 years. It's the honor of a lifetime for all of us to work together and to receive this award. We really and truly take care of our own. And to Jean Hersholt, humanitarian and our president at MPTF for 18 years, we're bringing you home tonight.

2020,93,2021-04-25,Union Station Los Angeles,Viola Davis,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Tyler Perry,"TYLER PERRY:
 Thank you. Thank you. That is, that's incredibly kind. Thank you so much. They only gave me a few minutes, so. I want to say a very special thanks to Miss Viola Davis, who is nominated tonight and doing this. Thank you, thank you, I really appreciate it. To the Board of Governors, especially to Whoopi Goldberg, Ava.

 You know when I set out to help someone, it is my intention to do just that. I'm not trying to do anything other than meet somebody at their humanity. Like a case in point, this one time I remember I was, maybe it was about 17 years ago, I had rented this building and we were using it for production. And I was walking to my car one day and I see this woman coming up out of the corner of my eye. And I say, she's homeless, let me give her some money. Judgment. I wish I had time to talk about judgment. Anyway, I reach in my pocket and I'm about to give her the money. She says: Excuse me, sir, do you have any shoes? It stopped me cold because I remember being homeless and having one pair of shoes and they were bent over at the heels. So it's like, yeah. So I took her into the studio. She was hesitant to go in, but we went in. We go to wardrobe, and there're all these boxes and everything around the walls and fabrics and racks of clothes. So we ended up having to stand in the middle of the floor. So as we're standing there in wardrobe, we find her some shoes, we help her put 'em on. I stand up. I'm waiting for her to look up. And all this time she's looking down. She finally looks up. She's got tears in her eyes. She said: Thank you, Jesus, my feet are off the ground.

 In that moment I recall her saying to me, I thought you would hate me for asking. I'm like, how can I hate you when I used to be you? How can I hate you when I had a mother who grew up in a Jim Crow South in Louisiana – rural Louisiana, right across the border from Mississippi – who at 9 or 10 years old was grieving the death of Emmett Till. As she got a little bit older she was grieving the death of the Civil Rights boys and the little girls who were in the bombing in Alabama. She grieved all this all these years. And I remember being a little boy and coming home and she was at home, but like, what are you doing at home? You're supposed to be at work. She was in tears that day. She said there was a bomb threat. And she couldn't believe that someone wanted to blow up this place where she worked, where she took care of all these toddlers. It was the Jewish Community Center.

 My mother taught me to refuse hate. She taught me to refuse blanket judgment. And in this time and with all of the internet and social media and algorithms and everything that wants us to think a certain way, the 24-hour news cycle, it is my hope that all of us would teach our kids, and not only to remember, just refuse hate. Don't hate anybody. I refuse to hate someone because they are Mexican or because they are black or white or LBGTQ. I refuse to hate someone because they are a police officer. I refuse to hate someone because they are Asian. I would hope that we would refuse hate. And I want to take this Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and dedicate it to anyone who wants to stand in the middle. No matter what's around the walls, stand in the middle, 'cause that's where healing happens. That's where conversation happens. That's where change happens. It happens in the middle. So anyone who wants to meet me in the middle, to refuse hate, to refuse blanket judgment, and to help lift someone's feet off the ground, this one is for you, too. God bless you and thank you, Academy. I appreciate it. Thank you.

 Ah, man. Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who was one of the most, the strongest, most delicate people I've ever met. I got to protect Saniyya and Demi, the two actresses that played Venus and Serena. I'm being called on in my life to love people, and to protect people, and to be a river to my people. Now, I know to do what we do you gotta be able to take abuse, you gotta be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business you gotta be able to have people disrespecting you and you gotta smile and you gotta pretend like that's okay. But Richard Williams, and what I loved -- thank you, D. Denzel said to me a few minutes ago, he said: At your highest moment, be careful; that's when the devil comes for you. It's like, I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena -- I just spit; I hope they didn't see that on TV. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That's what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern.

 I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment, and I'm not, I'm not crying for winning an award. It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine light on all of the people -- Tim and Trevor and Zach and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue and the entire cast and crew of ""King Richard."" And Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father just like they said... I look like the crazy father just like they said about Richard Williams. But, love will make you do crazy things. To my mother -- a lot of this moment is really complicated for me -- but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She had her knitting friends. She has a knitting crew that she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother and my family, my wife -- I'm taking up too much time. Thank you for this honor. Thank you for this moment. And thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene, the entire Williams family. Thank you. I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you.

 This is amazing to be here on this journey. I cannot believe I'm here. Thank you so much to all the members of the Academy for recognizing my work. It's really amazing that our film, ""CODA,"" has reached out worldwide. It even reached all the way to the White House. And they invited the cast of ""CODA"" to visit and have a tour of the White House and we met President Joe and Dr. Jill, and I was planning on teaching them some dirty sign language but Marlee Matlin told me to behave myself. So don't worry, Marlee, I won't drop any F-bombs in my speech today.

 Instead, I really want to thank all of the wonderful deaf theater stages where I was allowed and given the opportunity to develop my craft as an actor. Thank you. I read one of Spielberg's books recently, and he said that the best director, the definition of the best director was a skilled communicator. Siân Heder, you are the best communicator. And the reason why is you brought the deaf world and the hearing world together, and you are our bridge. And your name will forever be on that bridge, Siân Heder Bridge, here in Hollywood. And that was supported by Apple, Sundance, all our cast, our crew, our producers, and the community of Gloucester, Massachusetts. So I just want to say: Hey, fisherman. Hey, Popeyes. Don't forget to eat your spinach.

 My dad, he was the best signer in our family. But he was in a car accident and he became paralyzed from the neck down, and he no longer was able to sign. Dad, I learned so much from you. I'll always love you. You are my hero. Thank you to my biggest fans: my wife and my daughter Kyra, and my hometown of Mesa, Arizona, and Mark Finley, my manager, and our team. I just wanted to say that this is dedicated to the deaf community, the CODA community, and the disabled community. This is our moment. To my mom, my dad and my brother Mark -- they're not here today, but look at me now. I did it! I love you. Thank you.

I definitely would not be up here right now, I probably wouldn't even have a career, if it wasn't for Hylda Queally, Paul Nelson, Steve Warren and Nicole Perna. I love you guys; thank you very much. I just have to say your guys's names because I love you. Kristen, Nicole, Penélope, Olivia, I love guys so much, and to be included in the conversation with you is such an honor. I have to thank Michael Showalter, my director, who created a space that inspired creativity and love and courage. The incredible hair and makeup team, Linda, Stephanie, Justin, who really helped me find her. Producers Kelly Carmichael, Rachel Shane, Gigi Pritzker. I have to thank David Greenbaum, Matthew Greenfield, all of Searchlight, for shepherding our film. My scene partner and collaborator, Andrew Garfield -- the brilliant Andrew Garfield. Thank you so much for bringing out the best in me by showing up every day with the best of you. Thank you.

 And right now we are coming out of some difficult times that have been filled with a lot of trauma and isolation. And so many people out there feel hopelessness and they feel alone. And suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. It's touched many families; it's touched mine. And especially members of the LGBTQ community, who oftentimes feel out of place with their peers. There is -- we're faced with discriminatory and bigoted legislation that is sweeping our country with the only goal of further dividing us. There's violence and hate crimes being perpetuated on innocent civilians all over the world. And in times like this I think of Tammy, and I'm inspired by her radical acts of love. We've talked about love a lot tonight. And I'm inspired by her compassion and I see it as a guiding principle that leads us forward. And it connects us all in the desire that we want to be accepted for who we are, accepted for who we love, and to live a life without the fear of violence or terror. And for any of you out there who do in fact feel hopeless or alone, I just want you to know that you are unconditionally loved for the uniqueness that is you. Mio tesoro, Giulietta, Augustus. You are my heart. And I thank you all very, very much. Thank you.

 If I took the time to say thank you to every single beautiful person who has lifted me up on this stage you'd find people would be sitting here until next Oscars, so I'm not going to do that. But just allow me to say that it was the summer of a lifetime and I am the most privileged and grateful to have spent it with all of you. My god, thank you, Steven Spielberg; you're stuck with me now. Yay! Thank you, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Tony Kushner and the divine inspiration that is Rita Moreno -- you are staring at me right now. And I'm so grateful. Your Anita paved the way for tons of Anitas like me. And I love you so much.

 I'm gonna wrap this up and talk about my family. My mother, who is here tonight. Mama, I love you with my whole heart, and this is as much yours as it is mine. Some of my tribesmen, my family: my love Sue, Jonathan, Diana, Anthony Calamita. I couldn't do what I do without each and every one of you. So, lastly, imagine this little girl in the backseat of a white Ford Focus. Look into her eyes. You see a queer, openly queer, woman of color, an Afro-Latina, who found her strength in life through art. And that's what I believe we're here to celebrate. Yeah! Yeah! So, to anybody who has ever questioned your identity -- ever, ever, ever -- or you find yourself living in the gray spaces, I promise you this: There is indeed a place for us. Thank you to the Academy and thank you all.

 [Holding up the Oscar:] Team ""Cruella."" Go team ""Cruella."" Now if you heard the really embarrassing noises it was probably my family who are somewhere up there, who supported me through this extraordinary experience. Which had massive amounts of fun, as you can see, but also, it was slightly stressful. The only one I'm missing is my darling son-in-law David, who used to give me good advice at the end of every day but is no longer with us. Anyway, [looking down at her outfit] I just thought I should explain -- it obviously didn't go down well last time. This is honoring my inner Cruella: a little bit of Maddy Moxham, Random Lapel, Tom Davies eyewear, Thom Botwood graffiti.

 And I have to tell you when Kristin Burr and Craig Gillespie asked me to do this movie, I truly didn't think we had the time. I mean, I actually nearly said no. Glad I didn't. The only reason I didn't was because Clare Spragge -- who's sitting just there, sparkling -- said she would come on board as costume supervisor and bring the team. The team of the most phenomenal, creative, clever, generous, amazing people, I mean, without whom obviously it wouldn't have happened. And I also need to thank Nadia and Naomi and Julia, our makeup and hair team, because they complete the looks. I mean, you know, it would be a little sad putting a Cruella costume in my hair. But also, the actors who just brought such life. I think Emma Thompson hyperventilating over some of her fittings with joy was one of the highlights of my career.

 Anyway, I think that's all. [Paging through her show program:] I kind of, of course left the thing in the car and had to write it all on here. But I think I've probably -- people have made such wonderful speeches. But the lovely thing I think about a film like ""Cruella"" is it does bring a bit of fun and joy in these terrible times, which others have mentioned. [Music begins to play.] But, you know, it -- it was great to do. And thank you, Academy. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

 Kia ora, kia ora, Aotearoa, New Zealand and Australia. I love directing because it's a deep dive into story, yet the task of manifesting a world can be overwhelming.

They met the challenge of the story with the depth of their gifts: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jesse Plemons. And my whole crew, who are true hearts. I thank my brilliant producers. Tanya Seghatchian, who was always by my side. Emile Sherman, Iain Canning and Roger Frappier. Also, Kate Richter.

And I also want to say that there are tens of thousands of crafts people just like us, who are below the line, who come into work every day and work long and hard and who never get the opportunity to have this kind of recognition. And I just hope that each and every day, that on set, everyone takes a moment to just look around and look at all those talented people who work so hard to make beautiful films with all of you, so.

2021,94,2022-03-25,"The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)",Alfre Woodard,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,,NA,NA,Danny Glover,"DANNY GLOVER:
 I am amazingly grateful for this moment. To be introduced to my great friend, the most incredible, brilliant actress that I've had an opportunity to work with, is special -- Alfre Woodard. As Sam Jackson stood and talked about his work, I remembered Sam Jackson and myself were in a play reading at the Frank Silvera Workshop in New York. And who was directing that play reading? Morgan Freeman, 1980.

 One of the incredible things about receiving such awards is what to say. The many response speeches that I've planned, um -- this whole presentation was my speech, I think, in some way. But outside of that I respect and am honored by the Academy to present me with the Jean Hersholt Award. And at this particular moment in time we can think about our past, we can remember our past. But one of the things that I've come through, through my wonderful grandparents, who didn't allow their daughters and son to pick cotton in September, and sent them to school in September. And because of that, these heroic, amazing people in Louisville, Georgia, she was [unintelligible] the first person to graduate from college in her family and in her community. And she inspired me, my mother, because no one worked harder, no one dreamed harder, and no one just fought for justice. My mother was the regional president of the National Council of Negro Women in San Francisco. Her chapter raised more money than any chapter in the country for the Mary McLeod Bethune statue which stands outside of the organization's building right there. My dad, the most incredibly beautiful man that I ever met. Falling in love with him when I was five years old, an endless stream that was never separated in that period of time until he took his last breath.

 I listened to the amazing Liv Ullman. I can't -- just the feeling to be on this stage and to stand with her in... it's just amazing. It's just one of the great memories of my life. Like her movies. One of the great memories of my whole life as well, when you wanted to think about what are the ways and so what are the things you want to do in front of the camera -- having no idea that I would ever be in front of the camera at that time -- and what are [unintelligible], the feelings, universal feelings, that she's displaying that went beyond just Sweden, but carried us through our development in this part of human development as well? Those are things that happened. The opportunity to work with Alfre Woodard on ""Mandela,"" and other cases in other places, the opportunity to work with her has been one of the great pleasures in my career. To have so much incredible energy and incredible wisdom and an incredible love for what she does and for humanity has been incredible.

 I've also had a rich relationship with organized labor. As I've said before, my, I mentioned that my -- as it mentioned here, my mother and father, James and Carrie Glover, came at a point in time when the labor movement in San Francisco gave them a sense of purpose, raising the family and having this sense that they were on, in that bridge, they were connected to a larger story, a larger narrative. I have here with me a great friend of mine, George Gresham, who is the president and executive director, right here, of SEIU 1199 in New York, one of the great, great, great -- and you would know that artists had a home in 1199 historically with Bread and Roses. I'm here, there, in celebrating this, 'cause this belongs to them. This belongs to the workers that I had a chance to sit with and to support, as they walked out on their work for great justice and a better working place in that, in the country and where they were. I had the opportunity to work with Bruce Raynor. Bruce Raynor, who brought me to Mexico where we sat on the floor of a woman making $30 a week, trying to feed her family and have her once, just a few of her seven kids, come to, go to school. Bruce Raynor has been an extraordinary, an extraordinary part of my life as he allowed me to sit in the back rooms, and sometimes to make the tough decisions that have to be made to make this a better workplace, and then also a better world as well. Those are the ones with gifts that have been given me in this particular moment.

 And in life, and throughout that life, that strike of 1968, which began as the Black Student Union, was created the Third World Coalition of African American, Latino American, Asian American, and white Americans to talk about the truth. Our version of the 1619 Project of critical race theory. And how do you get here? How do you get to this point? How do you move and keep moving? It's because people move. People move and they continue to move. I am proud of being a part of that. And I'm proud of being someone who was moved by the work of Athol Fugard in South Africa and his writings, which Zakes Mokae, a wonderful South African actor... Zakes Mokae took me around to the homes and parties that South Africans, exiled, would have in San Francisco and the Bay Area. And somewhere about midnight they began to have the music of homeland, their homeland. The speaking about homeland. The tears and pain of being exiled here, not knowing what the future is in their homelands. And those stories moved us, moved me. And I was happy to be a part of that.

 If I seem repetitive in my comments it's because I didn't know that my speech was going to be here [referring to the presentation prior to his acceptance], and so I haven't referred to the teleprompter at all, um... at all because I don't... And sometimes we as actors become a little lost if we don't have a script. It brings it alive here, brings us alive here. And, as I've said, Samuel L. Jackson, Liv Ullmann, and those who have graced our screens and those who continue, I'm proud to be a part of this space and place. And thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

 Goddamn. Um... wow. Thank you. Thank you all. [Looking over at Washington:] And, thank you, man, for -- Goddamm [unintelligible]! [Walks over and hugs Washington, then returns to the podium.] Awesome! Uh, wow. As Denzel said, we've come a long way and done a lotta things, so I'm really, really proud to receive this statue. Another standout memory to add to our [motioning between himself and Washington] shared experiences. This is awesome. First, thank you, Governors, for this incredible honor. Who knew, you know, a little kid from Chattanooga, Tennessee, watching movies and wishing he could be here, get the votes of people who run an organization like this and says, Hey, I deserve something like this; thank you so very much. And I will say, you know, when I got this call last year it was totally unexpected, but I guarantee you this thing's gonna be cherished.

 As long as I've dreamt and imagined and practiced this speech, you know, it ought to be a piece of cake, but it's not. ""Together for Days,"" Stan, my first film credit in 1972 to here fifty years later. It's been a real pleasure making indelible impressions on audiences as Gang Member #2, Bum, Hold Up Man, and the unforgettable Black Guy, just to name a few. But every little taste of this biz made me want more. All those Saturdays I spent at The Liberty and The Grand, the segregated theaters of my youth and childhood in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Imagining that I was Errol Flynn or Kirk Douglas or even James Cagney -- even John Wayne. But going home and recreating those stories with my friends, or just by myself. Being awed during the Blaxploitation era wishing I was up on that screen and wondering, How the hell do you get in a movie like that? Discovering Peter Sellers, Bond, the Shaw Brothers, George Lucas. I knew I loved it, I just didn't know how to make it happen. And fortunately when it did in 1990, I was sober, loved and supported by my wife and daughter, my reasons for being and my biggest critics and my biggest fans.

 I knew very little about navigating this world but I was gifted with a wonderful publicist named Lisa Kasteler, who had to explain to me what she did and then she went out and did it. Then came Eli Selden. She came to a location shoot, contract in hand for a movie and a proposition I couldn't refuse, to be my manager. Thank you, E. She in turn led me to ICM and Carla Hacken, who paired me with the legend that is Toni Howard and Carter Cohn. And the pièce de resistance showed up, my lawyer, Deborah Klein. Too amazing to describe are the engines of what became and continues to be a rather decent career, with the extra added piece of Karen Sellars. A gigantic thanks to each and every one of you for the scripts, the deals, the faith in me, the push to be better, and making sure I lived in the comfort zone of knowing what the next two jobs would be, 'cause you know I love you for that. John Rigney and Level Four, a wink and a nod and a thanks for that call I asked you to make to me when you made it.

 The dream has been shared with my partner in crime, my critic-in-residence, my rock-solid foundation, and my best friend, LaTanya. We wanted to be Burton and Taylor but the Richardson Jackson/Jackson pairing has been quite formidable. You've allowed me to indulge my work habit to excess, a lot of times at the expense of your own ambition. This award is shared, a shared accomplishment. It's always been a two-man show. A laugh-out-loud thanks to Zoe for going to work with me all over the world, indulging my movie taste as a viewer and a daughter.

 And when I got the opportunity, I tried to represent this business the best I knew how. I got out there to entertain audiences the way Hollywood entertained me. Make them forget their lives for a few hours and be thrilled, awed, or excited at the big room where make-believe lives. Thanks to every person that's ever bought a ticket to any movie I was in. It's truly been an honor and a pleasure to entertain you. QT, thanks for the characters. Little Rob, I know you're back there! Robert Louis Stevenson, the man who created all those wigs. Every time I asked him, said, ""Make me somebody!"" and he did. Once again, thank you, Governors, for the recognition. It's an honor.

 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. That was my grandson Halfdan. And I was actually 13 years younger than him when I wanted to be part of the actor's group. And I wanted to be an actress and I went to the theater school in Norway, and I was going to show them Juliet in ""Romeo and Juliet."" I was 17 years old but I understood everything about her story. And she had just heard that Romeo was dead and now she wanted to take her life and she had a glass of poison. And the way I had studied it by myself -- I didn't speak much to other people but I did a lot on my own, even my first theater thing. And I came in front of the jury and I showed them what I knew about someone's death. It was a glass of poison and what I wanted it was to drink this glass and think of Romeo, and then slowly I would fall down and down and down on the floor and die. And then I heard from the three jury people, I heard the oldest of them say, in the middle of me going down and down and down, she said, ""Thank you, Liv Ullmann, this is enough."" I cried, and I couldn't understand it because it was the one thing I knew I could, it was acting. And I went home to my grandmother in Oslo and I rang the doorbell and she opened and I said, I didn't make it, and this is what I did, down and down... And she looked at me and she said, Oh, it's wonderful. She didn't understand a word of it. And then she took me into her bed and we went to sleep. And I was crying and she put the blanket over us and there I was lying so close to her and I felt so safe. And I felt this, this breathing, and everything in her neck; she smelled so well. And I knew that I belonged. And she was my best friend.

 From I was 11 we went and saw films. My whole upbringing was very often from films. Sitting in the quiet of the theater and watching the Italians, ""Miracle in Milan,"" ""Bicycle Thieves."" American movies, I cried with Susan Hayward, and so many others. I was them as a child. And the jury of my theater school where I didn't come in, they would never believe what happened to me. Because then a lot of things happened to me. As a matter of fact, in Norway sometimes it is impossible to have something happen to you because every must be alike and you have to live by a certain rule. Don't brag, don't show anything, and whatever. That's why I brought 20 people from Norway here today. So, so they can tell Norway, it is true, she got an Oscar! They are very important to me for that. And I continued my career, I did a lot of stuff in Norway. But coming out in the big world, meeting new teachers, all the time meeting teachers. Among actors. Among directors. Among so many thing, meeting teachers. Teachers that make me love to be part of the painters, the musicians, the dancers, everything that is part of art. I was one of them. Even Richard Rodgers -- you won't believe it -- he wrote a musical for me. And I don’t sing and I don’t dance! He gave me seven songs on Broadway! I was so lucky.

 And then I got to do ""Anna Christie,"" and John -- who I love and I haven't seen him for years, and... [walks over and hugs Lithgow.] And it was incredible. And I saw me and I thought, oh they must know and see this in Norway. They had a magazine cover saying this is the new Nordic star, Greta Garbo. And I was walking on Fifth Avenue, and there Greta Garbo came! And I was so full of myself. And I wanted to tell her, I am doing ""Anna Christie."" And I went towards her, and she saw me and she got really scared and she started to, to run! And I had to run after her. Because I had to tell who I was and why I was, and all of that. And she run faster and looked at me. And I run very fast, too. And we came to Central Park, and she looked terrified at me and went into Central Park, and I never saw her again. And I suddenly, I suddenly believed one thing. I was a little full of myself, you know. I was seeing me, but I wasn't seeing the other person. I wasn't recognizing the other person.

 And then when I did this musical with Richard Rodgers, and I was to give away a lot of money. Because all the actors on Broadway they collected money so we would help people who were living in war, and come with truckloads of medicals, and doctors and nurses. And all the theaters collected this money and I was the one to give it to the head of International Rescue Committee, Leo Cherne. And I made the speech and I gave him the money and then I asked, because my mother brought me up to do that, is there something else I can do? And he said, well, we are going with this truckload of medicines and doctors and so, do you want to come with us? And I said, well, how long will that take? And he said, it's for the rest of your life. And I went, and my life changed. It's about seeing other people, recognizing other people, not only seeing yourself and recognizing yourself and what life has given you.

 And I came to an island I didn't know very much about, where there was a lot of refugees from Vietnam, Macao. And I came there and I spoke with people. And then there was a place in Macao where it said, ""people with leprosy."" And I wasn't going to go in there. And then there was a priest, a Catholic priest, following me. And he looked at me. And then I went in because he looked at me. And I came on the inside and there on the ground was lying an old woman, and she was crying like a baby. And she was so severed in her face and her arms, and he looked at me. And I knew she's crying, I have to go down and take care of her. And so I did it. And the moment I came close to her, and we're holding her, and lifting her up a little, suddenly she stopped crying and it came this sound [gasps], like a little baby does when it stops crying. And here in the neck it was the same as my grandmother. And I realized, my grandmother is here. My mother, my sister, everybody is here as well. And it was an incredible change in what I really believed life was. I know life is about finding out who you are and why you are. And not so long after I came to India, and there was sitting a girl in an orphanage. And she was beautiful with long black hair, and we were sitting on her bed. And I did this [touches her hair] a little on her hair. And she did this a little on my hair, because it was long then and I was young then. And suddenly this little girl takes off a ring with a red glass stone and she gives it to me, and puts it on my finger. And I told this story to a Quaker... fundraising things, and they started to make a fundraising that this little girl had organized -- and, of course, she doesn't know about it -- but hundreds and thousands of dollars came in from the Quakers and fundraising that went everywhere because this little girl gave the one wonderful thing she had to me, who had everything. And that's why I am so sure there is no ""the other."" Recognizing is not recognizing yourself only, but you should recognize yourself only, I thought, but it's in relative to recognize other people.

 And I'm so grateful for this. When I got this call and it was David -- I call him David, now, because he's so gentle. I've said hello to him many times since I came. And he explained why I got this. I'm so grateful, and that John would come and give it away, it somehow makes a circle in my life. And my friends are here, they can tell the people in Norway why I got it. And thank you.

 So this is what the multiverse looks like! Oh, my goodness. I thank the Academy for this honor and for our studio, A24, for making such a bold film. And I'm grateful to Darren Aronofsky for throwing me a creative lifeline and hauling me aboard the good ship ""The Whale,"" that was written by Samuel D. Hunter, who is our lighthouse. Gentlemen, you laid your whale-sized hearts bare so that we can see into your souls like no one else could do and it is my honor to be named alongside you in this category. I wanted to tell you that only whales can swim at the depth of the talent of Hong Chau. And I started in this business thirty years ago and things, they didn't come easily to me, but there was a facility that I didn't appreciate at the time, until it stopped. And I just want to say thank you for this acknowledgement, because it couldn't be done without my cast. It's been like I've been on a diving expedition on the bottom of the ocean, and the air on the line to the surface is on a launch being watched over by some people in my life.

 I know every director agrees with me when I say a director is nothing without their incredible cast and crew. This, it's my family, my friends. If our movie has greatness and genius it is only because they have greatness and genius flowing through their hearts and souls and minds and they gave that precious gift to our film. The world is opening up to the fact that genius does not stem from individuals like us on stage, but rather genius emerges from the collective. We are all products of our context. We are all descendants of something and someone and I want to acknowledge my context. My immigrant parents: my father who fell in love with movies because he needed to escape the world and thus passed that love of movies onto me. My mother, who is a creative soul, who wanted to be a dancer, an actor, and singer but could not afford the luxury of that life path and then gave it to me. My incredible brothers and sisters, who helped me survive the chaos of childhood. My friends from high school, who taught me the, that, the -- sorry, I'm just going to keep going. The RCCC, you taught me the liberating freedom of creativity and joy and your DNA is in this film, as well. My incredible son Gio, you rearrange my DNA every day and it's awful and beautiful every single time. If you ever watch this, I hope you know that you should never have to live up to this standard. This is not normal. This is kind of crazy. I will love you no matter what. And last thing, I just want to go back to my original point. There is greatness is every single person. It doesn't matter who they are. You have a genius that is waiting to erupt, you just need to find the right people to unlock that. Thank you so much to everyone who has unlocked my genius. This means so much to us. Thank you to the Academy.

Because you learn by that. And you can show actually where we all, how we all can live together.
