1939,12,Spencer Tracy,Actress,Gone with the Wind,Vivien Leigh,"VIVIEN LEIGH:
 Ladies and gentlemen, please forgive me if my words are inadequate in thanking you for your very great kindness. If I were to mention all those who have shown me such wonderful generosity through ""Gone with the Wind"" I should have to entertain you with an oration as long as ""Gone with the Wind"" itself. So if I may, I should like to devote my thanks on this occasion to that composite figure of energy, courage, and very great kindness, in whom all points of ""Gone with the Wind"" meet -- Mr. David Selznick.
"
1939,12,Fay Bainter,Actress in a Supporting Role,Gone with the Wind,Hattie McDaniel,"HATTIE McDANIEL:
 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science[s], fellow members of the motion picture industry and honored guests. This is one of the happiest moments of my life, and I want to thank each one of you who had a part in selecting me for one of the awards for your kindness. It has made me feel very, very humble and I shall always hold it as a beacon for anything I may be able to do in the future. I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry. My heart is too full to tell you just how I feel. And may I say thank you and God bless you.
"
1941,14,James Stewart,Actor in a Supporting Role,How Green Was My Valley,Donald Crisp,"DONALD CRISP:
 Ladies and gentlemen, it's almost impossible to speak. You haven't been through this. It's alright up to that moment. What I want to do is say thank you to Darryl Zanuck, to John Ford, to Philip Dunne for the wonderful script, and for the opportunity to play such a wonderful part. I think there's quite a lot of the old timers knocking around that could do justice to some of that and some of you wonderful producers will look at some of these old timers and give 'em a chance. There's a lot of good blood there. I'm very thrilled, ladies and gentlemen, very honored, very grateful for this. And I do want to say that my little friend Barbara Stanwyck has been rehearsing me all week; she's handed me every lamp and statue on the set. So it was alright. Thank you again very, very much.
"
1941,14,Ginger Rogers,Actress,Suspicion,Joan Fontaine,"JOAN FONTAINE:
 I want to thank the ladies and gentlemen that voted me this award. And I want to say thank you, David Selznick. And if Alfred Hitchcock were here tonight I'd like to say to him, thank you, Hitch, with all my heart.
"
1941,14,Ginger Rogers,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Great Lie,Mary Astor,"MARY ASTOR:
 Ladies and gentlemen, twenty-two years ago this coming June I first faced a motion picture camera – I hasten to add I was very young. I'm going to let you write the rest of the script and just say thank you very, very much.
"
1942,15,Gary Cooper,Actor,Yankee Doodle Dandy,James Cagney,"JAMES CAGNEY:
 Ladies and gentlemen: Very happy. [Audience yells, ""Louder""] I said, ladies and gentlemen – I bend into my work here – very happy, very happy. According to the highly personal quality of our business, I've always had the feeling ever since coming into it, that you can only be as good as the other fellow thinks you are, or, I might add, as bad. And it seemed that quite a number of people have thought a good job has been done, and that makes me very happy. And just one added thought, I might say it was a pretty good part. Thank you.
"
1942,15,Gary Cooper,Actor in a Supporting Role,Johnny Eager,Van Heflin,"VAN HEFLIN:
 Stay here, oh yes, I need you.

 GARY COOPER:
 I'm no help for you.

 VAN HEFLIN:
 Well...I don't know, what did you say when you got it?

 GARY COOPER:
 I spent five minutes sayin' nothin'. Absolutely...

 VAN HEFLIN:
 Well, I'll just say...I'm...I'm so grateful to Mervyn LeRoy for helping me, to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to Mr. Mayer, for giving me a chance, to the New York theater for training me for it. [Laughs] To the Army for letting me come down and get this.
"
1942,15,Joan Fontaine,Actress,Mrs. Miniver,Greer Garson,"[The Academy has newsreel coverage of only portions of Garson's acceptance speech. While it is clear that the opening paragraph is the beginning of her speech, it is not known how the rest of the pieces fit together or the extent of the missing footage.]

 GREER GARSON:
 Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished visitors from the armed forces, Governor Warren, honored guests, Mr. Chairman – Mr. President Chairman: Thank you. That is really all there is to say; but, as this is after all the opportunity of a lifetime, I hope you won't mind if I try to expand that word just, just a little. This is, this is going to be a great evening to remember. We've had some very exciting messages and some very exciting speeches. It should make us all very proud to belong to this great and fascinating industry. Praise from our government and our armed forces and from abroad from our allies for work we have done should make us determined to carry on. We have somehow brought very wide horizons into this room tonight. Anything that I have to say now, which is practically unprepared... [camera cuts]

 As for the nominations, I've always felt that to be nominated simply means that you've had the great good luck to be entrusted with one of the best assignments of the current year, and that's a cause for rejoicing in itself. And there isn't a single good craftsman in this industry who if given such an opportunity can't be counted on to measure up to it. Why do we all long to win the award? It's no question of superiority because we're comparing different excellences and they're varied in their nature and they can't be fairly compared. There's no rivalry in this room tonight. There's no competition. As the Dodo said to Alice in Wonderland: ""Everybody has won and everybody shall have a prize."" The nominations are really the prizes. The award...I, I can hardly believe that it's really for me tonight. It's always seemed to me something very personal, a gesture from the men and women of this industry who choose to show not only recognition of, of work... [camera cuts]

 Ladies and gentlemen, I came to this country as a stranger five years ago. I've been very happy and very proud to be a member of this community and of this industry all that time. And from everybody I met or worked with truly I have received such ready kindness that for quite a long while I couldn't believe that it was true, but tonight you have made me feel that you have really set the door of your friendship wide open and that welcome is officially on the mat, and that is why I'm so happy. [camera cuts]

 ...very humbly, very gratefully I say thank you and I step across your threshold. There... [camera cuts]

 ...if I may say so, the girl who's always on the sidelines, my quite specially wonderful little mother. And after her, Sidney Franklin the great, the inimitable Willy Wyler... [camera cuts]
"
1942,15,Joan Fontaine,Actress in a Supporting Role,Mrs. Miniver,Teresa Wright,"TERESA WRIGHT:
 Thank you. I wish Major Wyler were here tonight so I could thank him first for his splendid direction. And I'd like to thank Mr. Mayer and Mr. Franklin for giving me the part. And I'd like to thank the people who gave me this because they're the people I work with and therefore it's doubly thrilling to get it from them. Thank you.
"
1943,16,Teresa Wright,Actress in a Supporting Role,For Whom the Bell Tolls,Katina Paxinou,"KATINA PAXINOU:
 Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share this great honor with, which is bestowed on me tonight, with my colleagues of the Royal Theatre of Athens whom, whether they are now dead or alive, fate has ordained me to represent here. I am deeply moved and I wish to thank Paramount, who offered me the chance to play ""Pilar,"" Mr. Buddy DeSylva, my director Sam Wood, and all those who, who are responsible for this happy moment. I would like to thank also the voters and the committee of the Academy Award for giving me, besides this honor, the opportunity to send through the air my, my deep love and admiration to the heroic boys, to the heroic soldiers of your great nation, the American boys who are fighting with their allies all over the world for liberty, justice and human dignity. Thank you again.
"
1946,19,Joan Fontaine,Actor,The Best Years of Our Lives,Fredric March,"CATHY O'DONNELL:
 I'm sorry that Mr. March couldn't be here for this award, but I guess you know that he's in New York in a very successful play. I think Mr. March was wonderful in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and I'm glad you did, too. So I want to thank you for Mr. March. Thank you.
"
1946,19,Anne Revere,Actor in a Supporting Role,The Best Years of Our Lives,Harold Russell,"HAROLD RUSSELL:
 Thank you very much. Two in a night is just too much! Thanks a lot.
"
1946,19,Ray Milland,Actress,To Each His Own,Olivia de Havilland,"OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND:
 Since I value highly the profession which has instructed me, rewarded me, and permitted me my share of the world's work, it will understand and forgive me, I know, for the very great pride I feel in receiving this symbol of its approbation, one of the Awards of Merit, for my part in this past year, what has been done. But even in this wonderful moment my common sense reminds me quite clearly that most of the work that went into earning this award was not done by Olivia de Havilland at all, but by a big team of other people who, if justice were really to prevail, would be standing up here beside me now. When I think of the writer who created ""Jody Norris,"" and how much of her sprang from the heart and mind of the director. When I remember the businessmen who found and managed the money which produced her and distributed her. And how she grew under the talents and skills of the technicians: the cameraman, the makeup man, the hairdresser, the costumer. And then I think how much the musicians did for her. Then I feel humble too, as well as proud, to accept this award which I do in the name of my team as well as my own. Thank you.
"
1946,19,Lionel Barrymore,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Razor's Edge,Anne Baxter,"ANNE BAXTER:
 I want to thank all the Academy members for this very great honor. And I'd like to present my appreciation to Mr. Zanuck for the opportunity to play ""Sophie."" And above all, my deepest thanks to Mr. Eddie Goulding, without whose fine direction and understanding ""Sophie"" never would have been. I'm deeply grateful. Thank you again.
"
1947,20,Olivia de Havilland,Actor,A Double Life,Ronald Colman,"RONALD COLMAN:
 Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy and very proud and very lucky. Lucky because I know I wouldn't be standing on this stage tonight without the grand contributions of so many others. A great script and a great part from Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. The wonderful help of George Cukor, Michael Kanin and Bill Goetz. And I'm not forgetting a splendid cast and all the departments that gave their skill and talents to making this picture. So, to all of them especially, my deepest gratitude. And to you, ladies and gentlemen, my warmest thanks.
"
1947,20,Anne Baxter,Actor in a Supporting Role,Miracle on 34th Street,Edmund Gwenn,"EDMUND GWENN:
 Whoow! Now I know there's a Santa Claus. Oh, you may laugh, ladies and gentlemen. It's not so easy to be certain, you know. He's a most elusive little fellow. He turns up in all sorts of places under all sorts of names and disguises. First time I ever met him he told me his name was George Seaton. And wonderfully, George Seaton has his revenge by bringing him to life. About a year and a half ago he suddenly turned up in Culver City and told me his name was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. That was the day Metro agreed to loan me to Fox to make the picture. And now I think it's time Santa Claus added a word to his name. I think he ought to call himself Santa Claus, Incorporated. Santa Claus, Inc. Inc.! For then he would embrace all you wonderful, kind people who have done me the honor of making me stand here tonight. Thank you, all of you, for making the evening of my life such a happy one. Thank you.
"
1947,20,Fredric March,Actress,The Farmer's Daughter,Loretta Young,"LORETTA YOUNG:
 [Taps three times on the microphone.] That's my heart. You know, up until now, presentations of the Academy Awards has been a purely spectator sport for me. However, tonight I, uh, dressed for the stage just in case.

 But in all honesty, I suppose I couldn't expect to be more elated than I was when I heard I was nominated, because I had seen and I knew the beautiful jobs done by the other four nominees: Rosalind's vitality and her great technical skill in bringing that classic character to life; Joan's expert craftsmanship in ""Possessed""; and the magic and delicacy that Dorothy McGuire brings to any role, and particularly in this one; and the superb artistry of Susan Hayward who succeeded in turning a very difficult characterization into an authentic character and a personal triumph. Yes, yes, I think my great thrill was when ""Katie"" was voted into that class. Course, we all know there wouldn't have been any ""Katie"" if it hadn't have been beautifully written and directed and photographed and... and magnificently produced by Mr. Dore Schary. For my part, I am thankful to have been in a picture that made so many people think fondly and possessively of their country, and of our industry that can give them those thoughts.

 And as for you [looking at Oscar], at long last! Good night and God bless you.
"
1947,20,Donald Crisp,Actress in a Supporting Role,Gentleman's Agreement,Celeste Holm,"CELESTE HOLM:
 Thank you, Mr. Crisp. Ladies and gentlemen, I have thought before tonight that I had already received the greatest award that an actress can have, which is to play a part in a picture in which one so wholeheartedly believes as ""Gentleman's Agreement."" Thank you, everybody, for making this happen. I am very proud to be a member of an industry which can promote so much understanding in a world which seems to need it so much.
"
1949,22,Jane Wyman,Actor,All the King's Men,Broderick Crawford,"BRODERICK CRAWFORD:
 If my heart would stop beating for a minute... Mr. Douglas said I was to thank nobody; I would like to thank all of you, and especially thank God.
"
1949,22,Claire Trevor,Actor in a Supporting Role,Twelve O'Clock High,Dean Jagger,"DEAN JAGGER:
 You shouldn't do that much of that. They suggested that if you had anything to say if you were lucky enough to get up here and get one of these wonderful things, you keep it to fifteen seconds, I believe it was. I can think of a lot of things I'd love to say and I couldn't say 'em in fifteen seconds. I would like to say this, because I hear a lot of kidding about what people say when they get one of these, but you do feel grateful to a few people that helped you to. And I would like to say to a man by the name of Darryl Zanuck, who's given me a couple pretty wonderful opportunities, to Henry King, a fine man and a great director, I'm very grateful. And I feel as emotional as the dickens about it. Thank you very much.
"
1949,22,James Stewart,Actress,The Heiress,Olivia de Havilland,"OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND:
 Your award for ""To Each His Own"" I took as an incentive to venture forward. Thank you for this very generous assurance that I have not entirely failed to do so.
"
1949,22,Ray Milland,Actress in a Supporting Role,All the King's Men,Mercedes McCambridge,"MERCEDES McCAMBRIDGE:
 I'm aware of those who have contributed to this moment, and thankful for them, but I would like to say to every waiting actor: Hold on! Look what can happen. Thank you very much.
"
1950,23,Helen Hayes,Actor,Cyrano de Bergerac,José Ferrer,"JOSÉ FERRER [in New York]:
 Hello, ladies and gentlemen three thousand miles away. Hello, my dear, beloved Helen Hayes, how wonderful to hear your voice. And I know it's kind of conventional to thank people, but I'm gonna be conventional because I'm sincere. All of you who are connected with this picture – Stanley, Mike, Carl, Frank Planer, George, Mala, Bill Prince, Morris Carnovsky, all of you – you know as well as I do that it's your Oscar as much as it is mine. Also, to you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy who voted for me, you must know that this means more to me than just the honor accorded to an actor, and from the bottom of my heart I thank you for what I consider a vote of confidence and an act of faith. And believe me, I will not let you down. And one more thing. I think the most important winner of all tonight is the man with the long nose himself who has ridden victoriously through the pages of dramatic literature for over fifty years, and this is just the beginning for Cyrano de Bergerac. Thank you very much.

 HELEN HAYES [in Hollywood]:
 Joe, I'm taking your Oscar and I'm gonna hang on to it for you, and congratulations from us all.
"
1950,23,Mercedes McCambridge,Actor in a Supporting Role,All about Eve,George Sanders,
1950,23,Broderick Crawford,Actress,Born Yesterday,Judy Holliday,"ETHEL BARRYMORE:
 I'm very honored to be asked to accept this award for Judy Holliday for her radiant performance in ""Born Yesterday."" I don't know exactly what she wants me to say but I think it's safe to say that she's very happy and very grateful. Thank you.
"
1950,23,Dean Jagger,Actress in a Supporting Role,Harvey,Josephine Hull,"JOSEPHINE HULL:
 How wonderful of you. Thank you all very much, and Mr. Brackett and all of the Academy. I've heard of these wonderful occasions for years and this is the first time I've been here. I must thank that 6 foot 4½ inch ""Harvey"" [pointing up to a tall nothing standing beside her]. ""Harvey"" has brought happiness for the past seven years all the way from Boston and New York, and here, which is the gateway to the world through Universal International. And they gave us a wonderful director, a wonderful staff, a wonderful cast, and you. Thank you.
"
1951,24,Greer Garson,Actor,The African Queen,Humphrey Bogart,"HUMPHREY BOGART:
 It's a very long way from the heart of the Belgian Congo to the stage of the Pantages Theatre, and I'm very glad to say that it's a little nicer here than it was there. I just want to pay a slight, as a matter of fact a very big tribute to Mr. John Huston and Miss Katharine Hepburn, because they helped me to be where I am now. Thank you very much.
"
1951,24,Claire Trevor,Actor in a Supporting Role,A Streetcar Named Desire,Karl Malden,"KARL MALDEN:
 I haven't much to say because I haven't been here very long, but I can tell you how I feel: great. Thank you.
"
1951,24,Ronald Colman,Actress,A Streetcar Named Desire,Vivien Leigh,"GREER GARSON:
 It's an honor and a thrill to accept this for you, Vivien. I hope you're listening in New York. We're all very excited about it. God bless you and congratulations. I know she would want to thank you if she were here herself.
"
1951,24,George Sanders,Actress in a Supporting Role,A Streetcar Named Desire,Kim Hunter,"BETTE DAVIS:
 I wish I were Kim Hunter tonight. I've been asked to pick up her award for her. I know if she were here tonight she would say: How wonderful, how grateful, and thank you very much. Where is her award? [She is given the Oscar.] I will tell her of your applause.
"
1952,25,Janet Gaynor,Actor,High Noon,Gary Cooper,"JOHN WAYNE:
 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to see that they're giving this to a man who is not only most deserving but has conducted himself throughout his years in our business in a manner that we can all be proud of him. Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He's one of the nicest fellows I know. I don't know anybody any nicer. And our kinship goes further than that friendship because we both fell off of horses into pictures together. Now that I'm through being such a good sport, spouted all this good sportsmanship, I'm gonna go back and find my business manager, and agent, and producer, and three-name writer, and find out why I didn't get ""High Noon"" instead of Cooper. Cause I can't fire any of these very expensive fellows, but I can at least run my 1930's Chevrolet into one of their big black new Cadillacs.
"
1952,25,Greer Garson,Actor in a Supporting Role,Viva Zapata!,Anthony Quinn,"KATHERINE DeMILLE:
 I can hardly believe I'm here. I'm sorry that Tony couldn't be here but when I let him know today by telephone I know he'll be a very happy man. Thank you very much.
"
1952,25,Ronald Colman,Actress,"Come Back, Little Sheba",Shirley Booth,"SHIRLEY BOOTH (in New York):
 Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I'm a very happy and a very lucky girl. My luck has many, many names. I won't attempt to list them all. All you have to do is look at the screen credits and you'll know what I mean. I never could have done it alone. You know I couldn't. It's been a long, long climb. I guess this is the peak, but the view has been wonderful all along the way. I want to thank my old friends for their faith, my new friends for their hope, and everyone for their charity. Thank you.
"
1952,25,Edmund Gwenn,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Bad and the Beautiful,Gloria Grahame,"GLORIA GRAHAME:
 Thank you very much.
"
1953,26,Shirley Booth (via live telecast from Philadelphia),Actor,Stalag 17,William Holden,"WILLIAM HOLDEN:
 Thank you. Thank you.
"
1953,26,Mercedes McCambridge,Actor in a Supporting Role,From Here to Eternity,Frank Sinatra,"FRANK SINATRA:
 Umm... That's a clever opening. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm deeply thrilled and very moved, and I really, really don't know what to say because this is a whole new kind of thing. You know, I've... song-and-dance-man type stuff. And I'm terribly pleased, and if I start thanking everybody then I'll do a one-reeler up here so I better not. And I'd just like to say, however, that they're doing a lot of songs here tonight but nobody asked me... [unitelligible]. But I love you, though. Thank you very much. I'm absolutely thrilled. Thank you.
"
1953,26,Gary Cooper (on film),Actress,Roman Holiday,Audrey Hepburn,"AUDREY HEPBURN (in New York):
 It's too much. I want to say thank you to everybody who in these past months and years have helped, guided and given me so much. I'm truly, truly grateful and terribly happy.
"
1953,26,Walter Brennan,Actress in a Supporting Role,From Here to Eternity,Donna Reed,"DONNA REED:
 Thank you. Oh it was a long walk, I didn't think I was going to make it. Well I'm very proud and I'm very grateful, especially to Columbia Pictures. It was a wonderful, wonderful experience, ""From Here to Eternity,"" but I think even more wonderful is from ""Eternity"" to here. Thank you.
"
1954,27,Bette Davis,Actor,On the Waterfront,Marlon Brando,"MARLON BRANDO:
 It's much heavier than I imagined. I... gosh, I had something to say and I can't remember what I was gonna say for the life of me. I don't think that ever in my life have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad. It's a wonderful moment and a rare one and I'm certainly indebted. Thank you.
"
1954,27,Donna Reed,Actor in a Supporting Role,The Barefoot Contessa,Edmond O'Brien,"EDMOND O'BRIEN:
 I'm very grateful. It really can't be March 30th. It must be March 17th.
"
1954,27,William Holden,Actress,The Country Girl,Grace Kelly,"GRACE KELLY:
 The thrill of this moment keeps me from saying what I really feel. I can only say thank you with all my heart to all who made this possible for me. Thank you.
"
1954,27,Frank Sinatra,Actress in a Supporting Role,On the Waterfront,Eva Marie Saint,"EVA MARIE SAINT (in New York):
 [Kisses the Oscar.] I may have the baby right here. But I would love to thank Elia Kazan, and Sam Spiegel, Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Boris Kaufman, all the longshoremen. Thank you.
"
1955,28,Grace Kelly,Actor,Marty,Ernest Borgnine,"ERNEST BORGNINE:
 At the sake of sounding repetitious, I just want to thank my mother for giving me the idea of going in and doing this, getting into this wonderful profession. My pop, for being steadfast. My lovely wife, for helping me. Thank you very, very much. And to the Hecht-Lancaster Organization, I just can't express my thanks. Thank you, one and all.
"
1955,28,Eva Marie Saint,Actor in a Supporting Role,Mister Roberts,Jack Lemmon,"JACK LEMMON:
 Well, since I have been in this end of the entertainment industry I've been very fortunate in working with only the highest of professionals. I would like to thank them for the help and the opportunities they gave me, and I thank you all very much.
"
1955,28,Marlon Brando (on film),Actress,The Rose Tattoo,Anna Magnani,"JERRY LEWIS (host):
 This, of course, is Miss Marisa Pavan. And I know –

 MARISA PAVAN:
 I'm so happy.

 JERRY LEWIS:
 I know you are. I know you are.

 MARISA PAVAN:
 Oh Anna, I wish you could be here. She would be so happy, [unintelligible], so moved. I've prepared a speech – I don't know, I can't remember a word.

 JERRY LEWIS:
 Dean has the same trouble.

 MARISA PAVAN:
 I just want to thank you all and I want to give you a kiss from Anna. [She blows a kiss to the audience].
"
1955,28,Edmond O'Brien,Actress in a Supporting Role,East of Eden,Jo Van Fleet,"JO VAN FLEET:
 I'm so happy. Thank you. There's so many, many people responsible for my being up here tonight. I'd like to thank them all but I must thank Elia Kazan. Thank you, Gadg. Thank you.
"
1956,29,Anna Magnani,Actor,The King and I,Yul Brynner,"YUL BRYNNER:
 I hope this is not a mistake, because I won't give it back for anything in the world. Thank you very much.
"
1956,29,Nancy Kelly (in New York),Actor in a Supporting Role,Lust for Life,Anthony Quinn,"ANTHONY QUINN (in Hollywood):
 Ladies and gentlemen, needless to say I'm deeply moved. At the risk of being misunderstood I want to humbly say to my fellow nominees that acting has never been a matter of competition for me. I want to say that I was only competing with myself, and I thank you very much for letting me win that fight over myself.
"
1956,29,Ernest Borgnine,Actress,Anastasia,Ingrid Bergman,"CARY GRANT:
 Well, it's a privilege to have been asked to be here in case Ingrid won this award, and now that she has, it's a privilege to try to thank her, to thank you for her. But alas, I have no way of knowing the exact depth and degree of her emotion when she finally hears the news that she's received it. So, dear Ingrid, if you can hear me now or if you see this televised film, I want you to know that each of the other nominees and all of the people with whom you worked on ""Anastasia,"" and dear Hitch, and Leo McCarey, and every one of us here tonight and in New York send you our congratulations, our love, our admiration, and every affectionate thought. Thank you for Ingrid.
"
1956,29,Jack Lemmon,Actress in a Supporting Role,Written on the Wind,Dorothy Malone,"DOROTHY MALONE:
 Thank you all so much. I'd like to, I don't know how much time we have, but I'd like to accept this award in the name of my late little brother Bill. And I'd like to thank especially the Academy because I'm sure that this year, the four other girls, such stiff competition, it was a real... I really appreciate it. And I know I haven't got time to thank such loyal friends as Edna Benoit, and my producer Mr. Zugsmith. And Universal and all it's board of directors have been, had such confidence in me, like Mr. Muhl. And I want to thank the Screen Extras Guild and the Screen Actors Guild because we've had a lot of ups and downs together, and you understand all the crews I've worked with. Thank you so much and God love you all.
"
1957,30,Cary Grant,Actor,The Bridge on the River Kwai,Alec Guinness,"JEAN SIMMONS:
 To accept the award for Alec Guinness tonight gives me a particular delight because thirteen years ago I worked with Alec in a picture called ""Great Expectations,"" and we were lucky enough to have the director, David Lean, who directed ""Bridge over the River Kwai."" Since then I've watched him give wonderful, wonderful performances. And so tonight, to Alec Guinness, a truly great artist, many, many congratulations. And on your behalf, Alec, may I thank the Academy. Thank you.
"
1957,30,Lana Turner,Actor in a Supporting Role,Sayonara,Red Buttons,"RED BUTTONS:
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very grateful. I'm very thankful. I'd like to thank Marty Baum, Bill Goetz, Marlon Brando, and most of all Josh Logan for their faith in me. I'm a very happy guy. Thank you very much.
"
1957,30,John Wayne,Actress,The Three Faces of Eve,Joanne Woodward,"JOANNE WOODWARD:
 I can only say I've been daydreaming about this since I was nine years old. I thank you very much. And thanks most of all to Nunnally for having more faith in me than I think anybody could have. Thank you.
"
1957,30,Anthony Quinn,Actress in a Supporting Role,Sayonara,Miyoshi Umeki,"MIYOSHI UMEKI:
 Thank you. I really don't know what to say. I wish somebody were to help me right now, 'cause I didn't expect so I had nothing in my mind. But right now I thank you for everyone who help me, and you, and you, and all American people. Thank you.
"
1958,31,"Irene Dunne, John Wayne",Actor,Separate Tables,David Niven,"DAVID NIVEN:
 I'm so loaded down with good luck charms I could hardly make it up the steps. People have been saying thank you for Oscars for thirty years, and I have nothing to add except thank you.
"
1958,31,"Bette Davis, Anthony Quinn",Actor in a Supporting Role,The Big Country,Burl Ives,"BURL IVES:
 I'd like to thank the members of the Academy. Especially want to thank Willy Wyler, Gregory Peck, and Sy Bartlett and Jim Webb for the nice words they wrote, and all of the rest of the company and the crew of ""The Big Country."" Thank you.
"
1958,31,"Kim Novak, James Cagney",Actress,I Want to Live!,Susan Hayward,"SUSAN HAYWARD:
 Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy, for making me so very, very happy tonight. And my special thanks to Mr. Walter Wanger who made this possible. I thank you.
"
1958,31,"Shelley Winters, Red Buttons",Actress in a Supporting Role,Separate Tables,Wendy Hiller,"HAROLD HECHT:
 It's a great honor to be able to accept this great award for Wendy Hiller, a great actress. Thank you.
"
1959,32,Susan Hayward,Actor,Ben-Hur,Charlton Heston,"CHARLTON HESTON:
 It's really true; when you stand here you'll want to thank everybody you ever knew in this business. I feel like starting with the first secretary or whoever let me sneak into a Broadway casting call. Ten years ago this month I made my first picture in Hollywood and since that time I've worked with a great many of you. And every one of you did something to put me here tonight. As for ""Ben-Hur,"" the men who worked on that, most of you you've been applauding, most of them have been applauded earlier this evening, including Willy. But I would like especially to thank, not only all of you and all of them, but Willy, and Christopher Fry, and Sam Zimbalist, who gave more than any of us. Thank you.
"
1959,32,Olivia de Havilland,Actor in a Supporting Role,Ben-Hur,Hugh Griffith,"WILLIAM WYLER:
 I am extremely happy to accept this highly deserved award for Mr. Hugh Griffith for his wonderfully humorous, human and sympathetic characterization of an Arab sheik. My only regret is that the people of the United Arab Republic will not be permitted to see his performance.
"
1959,32,Rock Hudson,Actress,Room at the Top,Simone Signoret,"SIMONE SIGNORET:
 I can't say anything. Oh, I thank you. I thank you so much. I wanted to be very dignified and all that, well I can't. You can't imagine what it is for me, being French. You can't imagine. And I want to thank Jimmy Woolf, and Jack Clayton, and Laurence Harvey because, it looks a little corny to say that, but you know that without them I wouldn't have never been here tonight. Thank you so, so much.
"
1959,32,Edmond O'Brien,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Diary of Anne Frank,Shelley Winters,"SHELLEY WINTERS:
 You know, it takes a lot of people to put this in your hand. First, someone has to write a dimensional role in a very fine motion picture. And next, somebody has to get you the part. Then you have to have a great director. And then you have to be nominated and voted. So I would like to thank the memory of that wonderful little girl, Miss Anne Frank, who wrote with such depth and perception about human beings. I'd like to thank my wonderful friend and creative agent, Mr. Herb Brenner. And Mr. George Stevens. And last but not least, I thank you, the Academy.
"
1960,33,Greer Garson,Actor,Elmer Gantry,Burt Lancaster,"BURT LANCASTER:
 When Miss Garson handed me this she very graciously said, ""So well earned."" And that was a lovely thing to say. I want to, needless to say I want to thank all the members of the Academy who expressed this kind of confidence in voting for me. And right now I feel so happy that I want to thank all the members of the Academy who did not vote for me. Thank you all very much.
"
1960,33,Eva Marie Saint,Actor in a Supporting Role,Spartacus,Peter Ustinov,"PETER USTINOV:
 Ladies and gentlemen, having been educated in an English school we were taught for at least fifteen years of our lives how to lose gracefully, and I'd been preparing myself for that all afternoon. Now I don't quite know what to say except that obviously, whatever people may think, you can't act by yourself. I want to thank all my colleagues, whom perhaps by what I did I prevented from winning themselves. It might have been naughtiness on my part. And also the cutter, and the producer, and the director who chose the best bits. Thank you very much indeed.
"
1960,33,Yul Brynner,Actress,Butterfield 8,Elizabeth Taylor,"ELIZABETH TAYLOR:
 I don't really know how to express my gratitude for this and for everything. I guess all I can do is say thank you, thank you with all my heart.
"
1960,33,Hugh Griffith,Actress in a Supporting Role,Elmer Gantry,Shirley Jones,"SHIRLEY JONES:
 Thank you very much. I can only think that I wouldn't be standing here tonight accepting this Oscar if it weren't for another Oscar – Hammerstein – and Mr. Richard Rodgers. And also for the belief of Mr. Burt Lancaster, Mr. Richard Brooks, and Mr. Bernie Smith having me and allowing me to play the part of ""Lulu Bains"" in ""Elmer Gantry."" This is the proudest moment of my career because of them. Thank you all.
"
1961,34,Joan Crawford,Actor,Judgment at Nuremberg,Maximilian Schell,"MAXIMILIAN SCHELL:
 Ladies and gentlemen, I know this award honors not only me but also the picture ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" my wonderful director, and the great cast and especially that great old man who was nominated for the eighth time now, Spencer Tracy.

 When I came first to this country I met the custom man. And he was asking what I was doing here and I said I'm going to do a film. And he said to me: ""Good luck, boy."" And I think that was very unusual for a custom man, and I can tell him now that I had it. Thank you very much.
"
1961,34,Shirley Jones,Actor in a Supporting Role,West Side Story,George Chakiris,"GEORGE CHAKIRIS:
 I don't think I'll try and talk too much. I just want to say thank you very, very much. Thank you.
"
1961,34,Burt Lancaster,Actress,Two Women,Sophia Loren,"GREER GARSON:
 Oh, it's such an exciting moment. I'm honored to accept this for Miss Sophia Loren and I wish so very much she could be with us tonight so that all of us here and our great television audience could share this exciting moment with this wildly beautiful and talented girl. Congratulations, Sophia, wherever you are. And we do so earnestly wish you good health and happiness along with this wonderful award.
"
1961,34,Rock Hudson,Actress in a Supporting Role,West Side Story,Rita Moreno,"RITA MORENO:
 I can't believe it! Good Lord. I leave you with that.
"
1962,35,Sophia Loren,Actor,To Kill a Mockingbird,Gregory Peck,"GREGORY PECK:
 Thank you, fellow Academy members. Thank you, Harper Lee, Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan, Russ Harlan, all of my good friends and associates at the studio. Thank you, members of the press who cover the local scene, critics, columnists across the country who approved of my work and said so. And I want to thank my family, my good, close friends, who have lent me inspiration and moral support and affection. Thank you very much.
"
1962,35,Rita Moreno,Actor in a Supporting Role,Sweet Bird of Youth,Ed Begley,"ED BEGLEY:
 I'm not Ed Begley. I've come a long way from Hartford, Connecticut. I want to thank Pandro Berman first because without him I wouldn't be in the picture. But I owe a great, great deal of thanks to Richard Brooks. A man for whom I had worked before; a fine director. But most of all, and this is from the heart, my agent George Morris. Really and truly this man had faith in me that I didn't have myself. I never dreamed I would get that part, but he had faith in me and he kept after it and I got it. Thank you very, very much.
"
1962,35,Maximilian Schell,Actress,The Miracle Worker,Anne Bancroft,"JOAN CRAWFORD:
 Miss Bancroft said, here's my little speech, dear Joan. Quote: ""There are three reasons why I deserve this award: Arthur Penn, Bill Gibson, Fred Coe."" Unquote. Thank you.
"
1962,35,George Chakiris,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Miracle Worker,Patty Duke,"PATTY DUKE:
 Thank you.
"
1963,36,Anne Bancroft,Actor,Lilies of the Field,Sidney Poitier,"SIDNEY POITIER:
 Because it is a long journey to this moment I am naturally indebted to countless numbers of people, principally among whom are Ralph Nelson, James Poe, William Barrett, Martin Baum, and of course the members of the Academy. For all of them, all I can say is a very special thank you.
"
1963,36,Patty Duke,Actor in a Supporting Role,Hud,Melvyn Douglas,"BRANDON DE WILDE:
 Mr. Douglas is in Spain and he wished me to thank the members of the Academy and his fellow actors and the entire group that was on ""Hud"" for this honor. Thank you.
"
1963,36,Gregory Peck,Actress,Hud,Patricia Neal,"ANNABELLA:
 Pat has a most wonderful excuse for not being with you tonight. You know she is expecting her first—fourth—child in London. But I know she's very happy, very proud, very grateful. She thank you all, all her thanks. And a very special one from Martin Ritt and for Paul Newman. Thank you all for her.
"
1963,36,Ed Begley,Actress in a Supporting Role,The V.I.P.s,Margaret Rutherford,"PETER USTINOV:
 May I, on behalf of a most distinguished, most deserving, and most funny friend, say thank you very much indeed.
"
1964,37,Audrey Hepburn,Actor,My Fair Lady,Rex Harrison,"REX HARRISON:
 Well, this is a very exciting evening for me and I feel in a way that I should split it in half [kisses Hepburn] between us.

 AUDREY HEPBURN:
 You deserve it all.

 REX HARRISON:
 I would like to thank everybody that had anything to do with the making of ""My Fair Lady."" It was a wonderful experience and I must thank George for being so marvelous with us, and Jack, and everybody else that's connected with it. And deep love to, well [looking at Hepburn], to fair ladies, I think.
"
1964,37,Angela Lansbury,Actor in a Supporting Role,Topkapi,Peter Ustinov,"JONATHAN WINTERS:
 I don't know whether Peter expected this, I certainly didn't. Otherwise I would have been sure to wear black socks. But I'll make this very brief. I'm more excited than if Peter were here himself. He's in England. I'm pretty sure in Europe. Obviously he isn't here; but if he were here, he, I'm sure, would be almost as speechless as me. That's about it. Thank you so much on behalf of the Academy, the industry and everything. I hope that covers everybody. Thank you.
"
1964,37,Sidney Poitier,Actress,Mary Poppins,Julie Andrews,"JULIE ANDREWS:
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is lovely. I know you Americans are famous for your hospitality but this is really ridiculous. I have so many thank yous. I only know where to start and that's with Mr. Walt Disney, and naturally he has the largest thank you of all. I wouldn't know where to stop. I would somehow like to try and convey my really deep gratitude and, and well, gratefulness – well I just said that, hadn't I? – for being made to feel so really welcome in this country. Thank you very much indeed.
"
1964,37,Karl Malden,Actress in a Supporting Role,Zorba the Greek,Lila Kedrova,"LILA KEDROVA:
 Do you know, really I am so surprised that I can't, I don't know what... I have to say, I think that I will say that, thank you to this marvelous people of [unintelligible] Academy Awards. And thank you, thank you so much my dear, dear Michael Cacoyannis. Because it was your fault, it was not mine. I will never forget it. Never.
"
1965,38,Julie Andrews,Actor,Cat Ballou,Lee Marvin,"LEE MARVIN:
 Thank you. Thank you all very much. I don't want to take up too much of your time; there's too many people to correctly thank for my career. I think, though, that half of this belongs to a horse some place out in Nevada. Thank you.
"
1965,38,Lila Kedrova,Actor in a Supporting Role,A Thousand Clowns,Martin Balsam,"MARTIN BALSAM:
 Thank you. I've just seen all those movies; I don't know what to say now. I'm elated. I'm delighted. I'm stunned. I want to thank UA. I want to thank Fred Coe. I want to thank Herb Gardner. And I want to thank all the people I've worked with and for. And the Academy. You've all made it possible. Thank you.
"
1965,38,Rex Harrison,Actress,Darling,Julie Christie,"JULIE CHRISTIE:
 I don't think I can say anything except to thank everyone concerned, and especially my darling John Schlesinger, for this wonderful honor. Thank you.
"
1965,38,Peter Ustinov,Actress in a Supporting Role,A Patch of Blue,Shelley Winters,"SHELLEY WINTERS:
 Thank you very much, members of the Academy, for giving this to me the second time in my life. I wish to thank very much my director, Mr. Guy Green, who truly understood the role I played better than I did. And I would like to especially thank Mr. Pandro Berman for not only making such a sensitive, beautiful picture about a subject of integration such as ""A Patch of Blue"" is, but for making the picture a box-office success, which is very important for subjects like these. And I'd like to thank my agent again, Herb Brenner. Thank you.
"
1966,39,Julie Christie,Actor,A Man for All Seasons,Paul Scofield,"WENDY HILLER:
 It is a great joy to me to accept this award on behalf of one of the finest and one of the most loved actors in my country. There is something very special in being recognized in a country other than one's own and I know that Paul Scofield would want me to say with great warmth and great humility, thank you.
"
1966,39,Shelley Winters,Actor in a Supporting Role,The Fortune Cookie,Walter Matthau,"WALTER MATTHAU:
 Thank you. The other day, as I was falling off my bicycle, I had the following thoughts: I was given a very juicy part; I was allowed to work with talented, exhilarating and beautiful people; I was given a good deal of money and a great deal of joy. And now, really, don't you think this is going a little too far? [Laughs.] Thank you, anyway.
"
1966,39,Lee Marvin,Actress,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,Elizabeth Taylor,"ANNE BANCROFT:
 Miss Taylor regrets very much that she can't be here tonight. I'm sure she must be very, very proud; not half as nervous as me, I'm sure. But she thanks you very, very much. Thank you.
"
1966,39,Sidney Poitier,Actress in a Supporting Role,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,Sandy Dennis,"MIKE NICHOLS:
 Sandy thanks you very much. I thank Sandy. It was nice to be up here.
"
1967,40,Audrey Hepburn,Actor,In the Heat of the Night,Rod Steiger,"ROD STEIGER:
 Thank you. Thank you very much. For maharishi's sake. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. I find it unbelievable, I find it overwhelming and I wish to thank the members of the Academy for such an experience. Secondly, if I may indulge myself, I would like to thank the people in the public who've been so kind to me. Thirdly, I'd like to thank Norman Jewison for his giving an actor freedom to make a mistake. Fourthly, and most importantly, I'd like to thank Mr. Sidney Poitier for the pleasure of his friendship which gave me the knowledge and understanding of prejudice in order to enhance my performance. Thank you, and we shall overcome.
"
1967,40,Patty Duke,Actor in a Supporting Role,Cool Hand Luke,George Kennedy,"GEORGE KENNEDY:
 Oh, I could bust. I have to thank Stuart Rosenberg for giving me the opportunity to even be here. And I must simply thank the Academy for the greatest moment of my life. Thank you.
"
1967,40,Sidney Poitier,Actress,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,Katharine Hepburn,"GEORGE CUKOR:
 I know that I as her friend have a great, great thrill and I'm sure Katharine thanks you very much. And I think it's a very, very hard choice you had to make. Anyway, I'm sure she'll be very happy. Thank you very much.
"
1967,40,Walter Matthau,Actress in a Supporting Role,Bonnie and Clyde,Estelle Parsons,"ESTELLE PARSONS:
 Boy, it's heavy! I have to thank David Merrick who let me out of my Broadway play ""The Seven Descents of Myrtle"" so I could be here this evening, and little did he know what it would really mean to me. I also first want to express my great gratitude to Arthur Penn, my own particular genius, for really showing me acting was something very special. And, of course, to Warren Beatty. And thank you all. This is a great moment.
"
1968,41,Burt Lancaster,Actor,Charly,Cliff Robertson,"FRANK SINATRA:
 Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Robertson is filming in the Philippines and unfortunately he is steeped in it, couldn't get away in time. But on his behalf, he thanks the Academy, and I wish him the joyous moment of his life right now. Thank you.
"
1968,41,Frank Sinatra,Actor in a Supporting Role,The Subject Was Roses,Jack Albertson,"JACK ALBERTSON:
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy. I didn't think I was gonna be this moved. I must say I'm glad I'm off the hook; it's the first one. And it's not the first time I've been an opening act.

 There are so many people to thank I really don't know where to begin. I'd like to thank Edgar Lansbury, Ulu Grosbard, Martin Sheen. Of course that wonderful, wonderful actress and great woman, Patricia Neal. And throughout the years I've had the help and encouragement of many people and to them I'm extremely grateful, but I must say that my eternal gratitude will always be reserved for the man who made this moment possible: Frank Gilroy, the author of ""The Subject Was Roses."" Thank you very much.
"
1968,41,Ingrid Bergman,Actress,The Lion in Winter,Katharine Hepburn,"ANTHONY HARVEY:
 When I asked Miss Hepburn what she thought when she had broken the records for winning the, breaking the records for nominations, she said, ""I suppose if I have lived as long as I have, anything can happen."" And I'm absolutely thrilled that it has happened. Thank you very much.
"
1968,41,Ingrid Bergman,Actress,Funny Girl,Barbra Streisand,"BARBRA STREISAND:
 [To the Oscar:] Hello, gorgeous.

 And I'm very honored to be in such magnificent company as Katharine Hepburn. And gee whiz, it's kind of a wild feeling. Sitting there tonight I was thinking that the first script of ""Funny Girl"" was written when I was only eleven years old, and thank God it took so long to get it right, you know. So I would like to thank my co-producer Ray Stark for waiting till I grew up. And Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, for giving me such a great score to sing. And Isobel Lennart, for writing such a terrific character. And all the Hollywood people who made our show into a movie: Herb Ross, and my dear Harry Stradling who I haven't let go since, and my dear friend and director, William Wyler. Wow. It's like, somebody once said to me, asked me, if I was happy. And I said, ""Are you kidding? I'd be miserable if I was happy."" And I'd like to thank all the members of the Academy for making me really miserable. Thank you.
"
1968,41,Tony Curtis,Actress in a Supporting Role,Rosemary's Baby,Ruth Gordon,"RUTH GORDON:
 I can't tell you how encouragin' a thing like this is. The first film that I was ever in was in 1915 and here we are and it's 1969. Actually, I don't know why it took me so long; though I don't think, you know, that I'm backward. Anyway. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Roman. And thank you, Mia. And thank all of you who voted for me. And all of you who didn't, please excuse me.
"
1969,42,Barbra Streisand,Actor,True Grit,John Wayne,"JOHN WAYNE:
 Wow! If I'd have known that I would have put that patch on thirty-five years earlier. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm no stranger to this podium. I've come up here and picked up these beautiful golden men before, but always for friends. One night I picked up two: one for Admiral John Ford, one for our beloved Gary Cooper. I was very clever and witty that night, the envy of even Bob Hope, but tonight I don't feel very clever or very witty. I feel very grateful, very humble, and all thanks to many, many people. I want to thank the members of the Academy. To all you people who are watching on television, thank you for taking such a warm interest in our glorious industry. Good night.
"
1969,42,Katharine Ross,Actor in a Supporting Role,"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?",Gig Young,"GIG YOUNG:
 Thank you, I'm really quite speechless. There are so many people to thank in the making of a picture. I thank the Academy. I thank the producers, Mr... Winkler – I hope I do better than that tonight. Mr. Winkler, Mr. Chartoff, Mr. Sills. Johnny Green, for his wonderful music. Our very talented director, Mr. Sydney Pollack. But in my heart I have a special thanks for a man whose friendship goes back many years with me, a man who always believed in me when things were not going well or going right. The man who gave me this part, my friend for many years, Mr. Martin Baum. Thank you, Marty. Thank all of you.
"
1969,42,Cliff Robertson,Actress,The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,Maggie Smith,"ALICE GHOSTLEY:
 Well, I'm standing here and I'm thinking that with a marvelous husband like Robert Stephens and a distinguished director like Robert Fryer and the courage of a man like Richard Zanuck; well, put those all together and you just can't miss. And they didn't. And we in America present this award to you, Maggie, with as much thanks as it is a tribute to your magnificent performance. And thank you, everyone, from Maggie Smith.
"
1969,42,Fred Astaire,Actress in a Supporting Role,Cactus Flower,Goldie Hawn,"RAQUEL WELCH:
 Thank you. It's a pleasure to accept this award for her. She couldn't be here because she's in London filming. But I know she would want to thank all her co-stars, Walter Matthau and Ingrid Bergman, her director Gene Saks, and Mike Frankovich. And I think it's wonderful for her. Thank you.
"
1970,43,Goldie Hawn,Actor,Patton,George C. Scott,"FRANK McCARTHY:
 In voting this award I think that the Academy has distinguished itself. I think it has done itself a great deal of good and shown what a good organization it is by recognizing and honoring so generously a fine performance by a great actor.
"
1970,43,Maggie Smith,Actor in a Supporting Role,Ryan's Daughter,John Mills,"JOHN MILLS:
 Well, I really, honestly was not expecting to be standing here with Oscar. I really was not. I was thrilled to be in the building, but I'm quite stunned and I'm completely and utterly unprepared. I was speechless for a year in Ireland, and I am utterly speechless at this moment. But I do want to say that I think it's a wonderful choice – for me, I mean. I really am terribly – everything sounds like a cliché, but I'm really, enormously thrilled. I do think competition is rather good, and I've been competing all my life. And I'm very thrilled that I've won this and I shall always remember this moment. Thank you very much indeed.
"
1970,43,Walter Matthau,Actress,Women in Love,Glenda Jackson,"JULIET MILLS:
 I know if Glenda Jackson were here tonight she'd be terribly, terribly thrilled. She's 100 percent a professional and this is a great night for professionals. I know she'd like to thank you most sincerely for this great honor. Thank you.
"
1970,43,Gig Young,Actress in a Supporting Role,Airport,Helen Hayes,"ROSALIND RUSSELL:
 Well, on behalf of dear Helen, who is First Lady of the theater and certainly first tonight in most of our hearts, I know that she would want me to thank George Seaton who directed her in the film, and her beloved friend and that great and wonderful producer, Mr. Ross Hunter, who produced the film. Thank you very much.
"
1971,44,Liza Minnelli,Actor,The French Connection,Gene Hackman,"GENE HACKMAN:
 Thank you. [Looking at his name in the winner envelope:] That's what it says.

 Thank you very much. I just want to start at the beginning just for a second and say, sitting out there next to Barbara Harris reminds me of my first acting scene ever. It was in New York, and the gentlemen sitting in front of us when we were doing that scene was my acting teacher, and I just have to mention his name: George Morrison. I want to thank him. Also, Mr. Billy Friedkin, who has already received his prize tonight, but I have to thank him because he really brought me through this when I wanted to quit. And Eddie Egan, who you all know. Mr. Phil D'Antoni. Roy Scheider, Roy. And last, a young lady who I met in New York many years ago, Miss Felippa* Maltese, and she brought me uptown. Thank you.
"
1971,44,"Sally Kellerman, Richard Harris",Actor in a Supporting Role,The Last Picture Show,Ben Johnson,"BEN JOHNSON:
 Boy, ain't that purty. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very grateful to the Academy. I had a speech all rigged up for this but the more I worked on it the phonier it got, so, I'd like to mention some people that has made this all possible: Mr. Peter Bogdanovich, the director of ""The Last Picture Show;"" his lovely wife Polly; Mr. John Ford, who had a lot to do with my doing the show; the entire cast and crew; and all of the folks down in Anarene, Texas – I think they deserve a big mention; last but certainly not least, Columbia Pictures. Now, if you got a crew like that behind you, you can't be all bad. And now what I'm about to say probably will stir up a lot of conversation around over the country. There's something I'd like to leave in everyone's mind throughout the world: This couldn't have happened to a nicer feller. Thank you.
"
1971,44,Walter Matthau,Actress,Klute,Jane Fonda,"JANE FONDA:
 Thank you. Thank you very much, members of the Academy. And thank all of you who applauded. There's a great deal to say and I'm not going to say it tonight. I would just like to really thank you very much.
"
1971,44,"Raquel Welch, Gene Hackman",Actress in a Supporting Role,The Last Picture Show,Cloris Leachman,"CLORIS LEACHMAN:
 Oh, thank you. I'm having an amazing life and it isn't over yet. Remember when Ben Johnson said in ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""I fought all my life against..."" whatever he said. And I feel I've fought all my life against clichés, and look at me, I'm a hopeless cliché.

 I can't thank anybody. I feel that we all have, are part of each other. That we've all contributed. And we work together and we're all the same people. And I love you all for all the experiences I've had. Except that I want to say to Cornelia Williams Hurlbut, my first piano teacher, and Rose Lorenz, my dancing teacher in Des Moines, and my father Buck Leachman who paid the bills – wait – and finally my mother, whose imagination and funny sense of humor and almost Walter Mitty life herself led to all of this. I'm deeply honored. Thank you.
"
1972,45,"Liv Ullmann, Roger Moore",Actor,The Godfather,Marlon Brando,"SACHEEN LITTLEFEATHER:
 Hello. My name is Sacheen Littlefeather. I'm Apache and I am president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee. I'm representing Marlon Brando this evening and he has asked me to tell you in a very long speech, which I cannot share with you presently because of time but I will be glad to share with the press afterwards, that he very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award. And the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry – excuse me – and on television in movie reruns, and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee. I beg at this time that I have not intruded upon this evening and that we will in the future, our hearts and our understandings will meet with love and generosity. Thank you on behalf of Marlon Brando.
"
1972,45,"Diana Ross, James Coburn",Actor in a Supporting Role,Cabaret,Joel Grey,"JOEL GREY:
 Don't let anybody tell you this isn't a terrific thrill. There are so many people always, and in this case it's very much the same. Firstly, I'd to thank Hal Prince who started it all. Next, Martin Baum, Manny Wolf and Cy Feuer. Bob Fosse, whose gift is enormous and helped me so much. The other players, among them Liza, Michael, Marisa. And especially Fred Ebb and John Kander, who wrote me the best songs in the world. I thank you, and I thank my wife. You're all loved. Thank you.
"
1972,45,"Raquel Welch, Gene Hackman",Actress,Cabaret,Liza Minnelli,"LIZA MINNELLI:
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Making the film of ""Cabaret"" was one of the happiest times of my whole life and I would like to thank everybody connected with it but most especially the artistic staff: Mr. Fosse, and Fred Ebb and John Kander. And thank you for giving me this award. You've made me very happy.
"
1972,45,"Cloris Leachman, Robert Duvall",Actress in a Supporting Role,Butterflies Are Free,Eileen Heckart,"EILEEN HECKART:
 I would like to thank the very first man who ever recommended me for this part, Howard Otway, and a darling crew, and of course you. Thank you.
"
1973,46,"Liza Minnelli, Gregory Peck",Actor,Save the Tiger,Jack Lemmon,"JACK LEMMON:
 Well, I tell you, I had a speech prepared…in 1959. I've forgotten it. If I took the time to thank all of the people, very honestly, that are responsible for this award we'd be here much too long. But naturally to Marty Ransohoff, and Filmways and Paramount. I am deeply indebted for them letting us even make the film, because nobody wanted to let us make it. To Steve Shagan and John Avildsen. It would take much too much and much too long and I'll have to do it personally later. And to a cast and a crew of people, I've never in my life been connected with anything that meant more to me and worked with so many wonderful professional people that cared and loved something so much. And they made it one of the great, great moments of my life, the making of that film, and that's equal to this honor, just the privilege of working with them, truthfully. And I thank them all and I love them and respect them.

 I just want to say one more thing. In recent years especially there has been a great deal of criticism about this award. And probably a great deal of that criticism is very justified. I would just like to say that whether it's justified or not, I think it is one hell of an honor and I am thrilled. And I thank you all very, very much.

 Almost for the first time in a long and tumultuous life, I'm almost speechless. I cannot possibly describe to you the emotions with which I receive this great honor at your hands, but I do have a few personal gratitudes that I would like to express. For all those who worked with me on ""The Paper Chase,"" for their great kindness and generosity at the appearance of a mysterious intruder in their midst. For Gordon Willis, whose extraordinarily dramatic camera work did a great deal to create the character of ""Dr. Kingsfield."" And thirdly, fourthly and fifthly, to my dear friend Jim Bridges, as a writer, as the director and as the extraordinarily reckless young man who had the unspeakable gall to select an aging and obscure schoolmaster to play this perfectly glorious part.

 I'm very, very honored that Glenda has asked me to accept this award for her. You have honored a very great lady as well as a very great actress. And I know she'd be aware of our time problems here tonight and I know she'd be short and succinct in whatever thanks she has. I'm pretty sure she'd thank her director; she'd probably thank her producer; and she'd undoubtedly thank her writers. And as two-and-a-half of those fellows, I'd like to say, Glenda, you're welcome, and you are very welcome indeed. And I must congratulate you, my fellow Academy Award members, in selecting this really magnificent woman, this great lady, for this very great honor. Thank you very much.

 Thank you, Glenda. Ladies and gentlemen and members of the Academy. What other words beside thank you, Paul Mazursky and Josh Greenfeld, for a gem of a script. And particularly for my wife Barbara, and my agent/manager/father-confessor, William Francis Xavier McCaffrey, for twenty-five years, who said two words to me: Do it! You are old! Thank you very much.

"
1974,47,Jack Lemmon,Actress,Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,Ellen Burstyn,"MARTIN SCORSESE:
 Thank you. Ellen is in a play tonight in New York; she can't be here. She asked me to thank everyone concerned with the voting, the Academy, who voted for her. Also the entire cast and crew of ""Alice."" And also especially John Calley and Robert Getchell. And she also asked me to thank myself. Thank you.
"
1974,47,"Katharine Ross, Peter Falk",Actress in a Supporting Role,Murder on the Orient Express,Ingrid Bergman,"INGRID BERGMAN:
 Thank you very much indeed. It's always very nice to get an Oscar. But in the past he has shown that he is very forgetful and also has the wrong timing. Because last year when ""Day and Night"" won for the best picture I couldn't believe it that Valentina Cortese was not nominated, because she gave the most beautiful performance. [Finds Cortese in the audience:] There you are! She gave the most beautiful performance that all we actresses recognized because, after all, we have all forgotten our lines and always open the wrong doors, and it was wonderful to see her do it so beautifully. Therefore I am... It's so ironic that this year she's nominated when the picture won last year. I don't quite understand that, but here I am and I'm her rival and I don't like it at all. Please forgive me, Valentina. I didn't mean to. Thank you.
"
1975,48,Art Carney,Actor,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,Jack Nicholson,"JACK NICHOLSON:
 Well, I guess this proves there are as many nuts in the Academy as anywhere else. But, since you gave me the chance, I'm really happy to get an opportunity to thank Saul and Michael and Louise and Brad and Lawrence and Bo, and all of the guys in the company, all of the feebs brigade. And I'd like to thank Miss Pickford who, incidentally, I believe was the first actor to get a percentage of her pictures. And speaking of a percentage, last but not least, my agent, who about ten years ago advised me that I had no business being an actor. Thank you.
"
1975,48,"Ben Johnson, Linda Blair",Actor in a Supporting Role,The Sunshine Boys,George Burns,"GEORGE BURNS:
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is a beautiful moment for me. You know, I've been in show business all of my life and I've loved every minute of it. And being honored tonight by getting this award proves one thing: that if you stay in the business long enough and if you can get to be old enough, you get to be new again. I was very fortunate to work with two fine actors like Walter Matthau and Dick Benjamin, and to be directed by Herb Ross, and a script by Neil Simon, and with a great producer like Ray Stark, and for a beautiful studio like MGM. And being surrounded by all that talent was a great break for a newcomer like myself. And the last picture I made was thirty-seven years ago, and making ""The Sunshine Boys"" was so exciting I've decided that I'm gonna make a picture every thirty-seven years. Thank you.
"
1975,48,"Charles Bronson, Jill Ireland",Actress,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,Louise Fletcher,"LOUISE FLETCHER:
 Well, it looks like you all hated me so much that you've given me this award for it, and I'm loving every minute of it. And all I can say is I've loved being hated by you. I'd like to thank Fred Roos for remembering me, Milos Forman for choosing me, Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz for taking a chance and giving me a chance, and Jack Nicholson and a cast of actors whose professionalism, humor and capacity for getting into their roles made being in a mental institution like being in a mental institution. And if you'll excuse me [using sign language]: for my mother and my father, I want to say thank you for teaching me to have a dream. You are seeing my dream come true. Thank you.

 Thank you. I really must have won it otherwise why would I wear an old wedding dress? I think we [referring to the Oscar] had a fight twenty years ago, but he's changed. I know I haven't. But I would like to thank the artistic community for sustaining me in my wins and losses and sitting on the curb, whatever it was. I don't think there's an award for what Warren Beatty had to do to get ""Shampoo"" on, but I respect him and love him, and Robert Towne. And my director Hal Ashby, who encourages an actor to fly without a net because you know that he's there to catch you. Thank you.

 For some obscure reason I'm up here accepting an award for Peter Finch, or Finchie as everybody who knew him called him. There is no reason for me to be here. There's only one person who should be up here accepting this award and that's the person who Finch wanted up here accepting his award: Mrs. Peter Finch. Are you in the house, Eletha? Come up and get your award.

 MRS. PETER FINCH:
 I want to say thanks to the members of the Academy and my husband. I wish he was here tonight to be with us all, but since he isn't here I'll always cherish this for him. And before he died he said to me, ""Darling, if I win I want to say thanks to my fellow actors who have given me encouragement over the years; and thanks to Paddy Chayefsky who have given him the part; and thanks to Barry who have tell us to come from Jamaica, to come and do this part."" And he says, ""Most of all, thanks to you, darling, for sending the right vibes the right way. And thanks, the members of the Academy Award."" Thank you all.

 [Holds the Oscar statuette by the head] I'm holding that right? It's beautiful. Thank you very much for the honor of the nomination and also the honor of this award. And I just want to say that I take this in honor for my producer Robert Redford, and my great fellow actor, who showed such integrity, honesty and perseverance in this project. And in honor of Alan Pakula, our director, and also Ben Bradlee for being alive so that he would let me come out and play with him. Thank you very much.
"
1976,49,Louise Fletcher,Actress in a Leading Role,Network,Faye Dunaway,"FAYE DUNAWAY:
 It is heavy. Well, I didn't expect this to happen quite yet but I do thank you very much and I'm very grateful. I would like especially to thank Sidney Lumet, Paddy Chayefsky, Howard Gottfried, Danny Melnick, and the great generosity of a rare group of actors, company of actors, in particular William Holden, Robert Duvall and Peter Finch. And may I just add, an especial thank you to the friends in the back room: Susan Germaine and Lee Harman. Thank you.
"
1976,49,"Sylvester Stallone, Muhammad Ali",Actress in a Supporting Role,Network,Beatrice Straight,"BEATRICE STRAIGHT:
 It's very heavy. And I'm the dark horse. And thank you so much, all of you. It's a great, great thrill for me and very unexpected. Though I should have known that when I had someone like Paddy Chayefsky writing and saying things that we all feel but can't express, and when we have someone like Sidney Lumet who makes one want to act forever, and a producer like Howard Gottfried, then how can I miss? But I know that my mother would be delighted. She had great potential for an actress but didn't think she should do it, so she pushed me and was delighted. And Michael Chekhov, the great actor and teacher who I studied with, who gave me a love and respect for the theater, which is the whole point of why we're all here. It's a great profession and we have to keep thinking it all the time. And we all do. And we all love it. And I'm so grateful for that and for a wonderful lady, age ninety-three, who lives here in Los Angeles, who's watching tonight. One of our first women directors, who directed Paul Robeson in ""Othello"" in London: Ellen van Volkenburg Browne. Bright as ever. Thank you. And last but not least, my husband, who's put up with me for twenty-eight years. Thank you so, so much.

 I didn't prepare anything. Ahhm... [laughs]. Wait a second, am I here? Yes, okay. First I will embarrass Ray Stark by saying that I owe him everything; and he is a great man. To Herb Ross, who is the only true gentleman I've ever known in my life. To Herb, Marsha, and Neil, and Quinn. I could go on and on and on and I don't want to leave. Can I rent this [referring to the podium] now? Thank you very much.

 Mercy. Well then, this is terrific. It's simply terrific. Naturally I'm very honored to have been nominated with actresses like Jane Fonda and Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft and Marsha Mason; this is something. Anyway, ""Annie Hall"" was a wonderful experience for me and I just would like to say thanks to Woody, and thank you. Thank you very much.
"
1977,50,John Travolta,Actress in a Supporting Role,Julia,Vanessa Redgrave,"VANESSA REDGRAVE:
 My dear colleagues, I thank you very, very much for this tribute to my work. I think that Jane Fonda and I have done the best work of our lives and I think this was in part due to our director, Fred Zinnemann. And I also think it's in part because we believed and we believe in what we were expressing. Two, out of millions, who gave their lives and were prepared to sacrifice everything in the fight against fascist and racist Nazi Germany. And I salute you and I pay tribute to you and I think you should be very proud that in the last few weeks you've stood firm and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression. And I salute that record, and I salute all of you for having stood firm and dealt a final blow against that period when Nixon and McCarthy launched a worldwide witch hunt against those who tried to express in their lives and their work the truth that they believed in. I salute you, and I thank you, and I pledge to you that I will continue to fight against anti-Semitism and fascism. Thank you.
"
1978,51,"Ginger Rogers, Diana Ross",Actor in a Leading Role,Coming Home,Jon Voight,"JON VOIGHT:
 I am still reeling really from the appearances just recently on this stage. I don't think there's an actor here or watching this proceeding tonight who doesn't acknowledge a great debt to the continuing legacy of Laurence Olivier. And his presence here tonight has put a great perspective and just, on the proceedings for me, and a warm and generous and dignified one, and I'm not quite able to recover from it, I tell you.

 The performances this year in this category are remarkable, really. I am a great fan of the other members of the nominated body. And I know that we are all extremely aware of the extraordinary performances that we have been selected to represent. For my own part I have, as we all do, many people to thank for a performance which stands among this group of performances. I would like to thank everyone, but I select to thank a few who represent the many.

 I would like to thank Bruce Dern, my friend, for his encouragement and his wonderful performance, and his friendship. I would like to thank Jerry Hellman, who produced also ""Midnight Cowboy;"" is an extraordinary man, a great producer, a tenacious fighter, who keeps us all healthy and has great taste. I would like to thank Hal Ashby, a remarkable, a remarkable person who was so helpful in getting me to myself and encouraging my performance. And finally I would like to thank Jane, whose great dignity as a human being – it's a good thing she's not here to see this – is very moving to me. And finally, I'm carrying with me all the men who gave me so much of their experience to deal with, who have contributed so much: the people in chairs, and the veterans, and the civilians, and the walkers, who are so strongly represented in what I'd call my work. Thank you very much.

 Thank you, Michael. I'm very happy to have this. I salute Michael Cimino with this Oscar here tonight. And I'd like to add my thanks to the members of the Academy and to Mr. Robert De Niro. Thank you all.
"
1978,51,"Richard Dreyfuss, Shirley MacLaine",Actress in a Leading Role,Coming Home,Jane Fonda,"JANE FONDA:
 [Speaking simultaniously in sign language:] I'm so happy. I wanted to win very much because I'm so proud of ""Coming Home,"" and I want many people to see the movie. I'm signing part of what I'm saying tonight because, while we were making the movie, we all became more aware of the problems of the handicapped. Over 14 million people are deaf. They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them. [End sign language.]

 I'm so proud and grateful. It's been almost eight years. This film, ""Coming Home,"" was born in Santa Monica where we live, in the cramped offices of the Indochina Peace Campaign, as a lot of us whose lives have been bound up with the war sat on the floor. And some of them were veterans. I thank, I thank all of them. One of them was my husband, Tom Hayden; one of them was Bruce Gilbert, who has become my partner and is the associate producer of ""Coming Home.""

 I want to thank Waldo Salt, the first – how do you...? Heavy. The first industry heavy who stuck his neck out and believed in the project. In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing. And he led us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us. And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much. And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch. And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors. And I want to thank Penny Milford and Bobby Carradine and Bruce Dern and my pal Jon Voight, and Mike Medavoy and Eric Pleskow and Arthur Krim and Marcia Nasatir for getting us the money to make it.

 And finally I want to thank my children, Troy and Vanessa, for being understanding and forgiving me my absences. And again my husband, who helped me believe that besides being entertaining movies can inspire and teach and even be healing. Thank you, all of you. Thank the Academy very much.
"
1978,51,"George Burns, Brooke Shields",Actress in a Supporting Role,California Suite,Maggie Smith,"MAGGIE SMITH:
 I just, I just really can't believe it. I'm very, very honored and very grateful. I would like to thank Neil Simon. I would like to thank Herbie Ross. And I would very much like Michael Caine to be here, because believe you me, he was the most supporting actor ever in the world, and it really should go right down the middle. Thank you very much indeed.
"
1979,52,Jane Fonda,Actor in a Leading Role,Kramer vs. Kramer,Dustin Hoffman,"DUSTIN HOFFMAN:
 Thank you. [Inspects the Oscar.] He has no genitalia and he's holding a sword. I'd like to thank my parents for not practicing birth control.

 I'm up here with mixed feelings. I've been critical of the Academy, and for reason. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be able to work. I am greatly honored for being chosen by the producer, Stanley Jaffe, and the director, Bob Benton, and to have worked in a family with them, and with Meryl and with Justin, who if he loses again we'll have to give him a lifetime achievement award. And to Jane Alexander and to Jerry Greenberg and to Néstor and to the crew on the film who was part of that family. And to the crew and to the directors like Bob Fosse and Mike Nichols and John Schlesinger that I've worked with before. We are laughed at when we are up here, sometimes, for thanking. But when you work on a film you discover that there are people who are giving that artistic part of themself that goes beyond a paycheck, and they are never up here. And many of them are not members of the Academy, and we never hear of them. But this Oscar is a symbol, I think, and it is given for appreciation from those people whom we never see. They are part of our life.

 I refuse to believe that I beat Jack Lemmon, that I beat Al Pacino, that I beat Peter Sellers. I refuse to believe that Robert Duvall lost. We are a part of an artistic family. There are sixty thousand actors in this Academy – pardon me – in the Screen Actors Guild, and probably a hundred thousand in Equity. And most actors don't work, and a few of us are so lucky to have a chance to work with writing and to work with directing. Because when you're a broke actor you can't write; you can't paint; you have to practice accents while you're driving a taxi cab. And to that artistic family that strives for excellence, none of you have ever lost and I am proud to share this with you. And I thank you.

1979,52,Richard Dreyfuss,Actress in a Leading Role,Norma Rae,Sally Field,"SALLY FIELD:
 Oh, I'm gonna be the one to cry tonight, I'll tell you right now. They said this couldn't be done.

 ""Norma Rae"" was a real gift to me. It was given to me by Laddie and Jay and Gareth of the old Fox. It was given to me by Alex Rose and Tamara Asseyev, who fought very hard to get it made. It was given to me by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. And it truly was a gift, every single word. It was given to me by John Alonzo, who followed me around with a camera and never hoped to shine himself, just gave it all to me. It was given to me by the actors, especially Beau Bridges and Ron Leibman, whose real craft and talent and love and support is why I'm here.

 And mostly it was given to me because of Marty Ritt. Marty Ritt is ""Norma Rae."" He has fought all his life to put on films that are courageous, that say things, that are part of him that he feels should be said, that have the box-office potential of seventy-five cents, sometimes less. And I thank him for that. He's taught me a lot. And the best gift that Marty gave me was that he let me feel all the time that I was doing it myself, and I know that I didn't.

 And on a personal note, I'd like to thank my mother and my sister for holding me together and just plain old holding me. And my kids, Peter and Eli, for being my constant inspiration, and no matter how many awards I win, if it weren't them I wouldn't be worth a damn. Thank you very much.

 [He pulls out his notes.] I forgot my lines so the director wrote them down for me. I want to thank everyone. Since it's said so often, but it's true and it's...what can I say? I want to thank Bruno, Richard Bruno, for the terrific costumes. Frank Warner, Cis Corman, Pete Savage, and if Pete wasn't involved in the film he wouldn't have gotten it started—I'm a little nervous, excuse me—the film never would have gotten started. Mike Westmore, for the makeup. Mary Keats, the late Jean Burt Reilly, Irwin Winkler and Bob Chartoff. Vickie La Motta and all the other wives, and Joey La Motta even though he's suing us. I hope that settles soon enough so I can go over to his house and eat once in a while. And Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, who wrote the script. And of course, Jake La Motta, whose life it's all about. And Marty Scorsese, who gave me and all the other actors and everyone on the film all the love and trust that anyone could give anyone and is just wonderful as a director. And I want to thank my mother and father for having me. And my grandmother and grandfather, for having them. And everyone else involved in the film. And I hope that I can share this with anyone that it means anything to and the rest of the world, and especially all the terrible things that are happening. I love everyone.

 Well I'm gonna to have to figure out something new to dream about, that's for sure. Nobody ever accused me of being a fast talker but I'm gonna try tonight because this supporting actress was supported by a great many people, a few whom I would like to quickly thank.

 I'd like to thank my family in Arkansas for always believing against all odds that something like this was gonna happen. And then I'd like to thank two teachers, Sandy Meisner and Kenneth Gillam*, for the profound influence that they had upon my work. And then if anybody ever had a patron saint it was me. In 1977, when he insisted on casting me as his leading lady in a film called ""Goin' South,"" everybody told him he was crazy. But thank goodness for me that he was and is Jack Nicholson. Thank you very much.

 There's a couple more. Thank you, Melvin Dummar, for the inspiration. Bo Goldman, for the simple splendor of your words. And Jonathan Demme, thank you for your vision and your talent and for the plain, old-fashioned fun it was to work with you. Thank you, Don Phillips and Art Linson, our producers. Jason Robards, Paul Le Mat, Pamela Reed and the rest of the wonderful cast and crew of ""Melvin and Howard."" And last of all, I must thank you, Malcolm, for making life so nice that I feel like tap dancing. Thanks a lot.

1981,54,Sissy Spacek,Actor in a Leading Role,On Golden Pond,Henry Fonda,"JANE FONDA:
 Oh, Dad, I'm so happy and proud for you. My father didn't really believe that this was going to happen but he told me a while back that if it did he wanted his wife Shirlee to accept the award for him. But Shirlee wanted to be with him tonight, as is her way, and so I'm here.

 And first and foremost I want to thank on behalf of my father the members of the Academy who voted to give him this award. I know that he's watching right now and I know that he's very, very honored and very happy and surprised. And I'll bet when he heard it just now, I bet he said, ""Hey, ain't I lucky?"" As though luck had anything to do with it. I know also that he has tremendous respect for the other actors that were nominated and has always felt a little strange about these things, these competitions, because it's like comparing apples and oranges, and he feels very proud to have been among such a wonderful group.

 And I know that he feels that he would never have won this if it hadn't been for Katharine Hepburn. And if ""On Golden Pond"" is one of the highlights of his life, one of the main reasons is because of her, having the chance to work with her and to become her friend. And I know that one of the other reasons that he feels the film was so special is because of the quality of the crew. Every one of them, many of whose talents have been recognized tonight in the nominations. And the wonderful cast: Dougie McKeon, Dabney Coleman, Bill Lanteau, me—he's a proud father. The man who pulled us all together, our producer Bruce Gilbert. He is, my father is so happy, he feels so fortunate to have been able to play the role of ""Norman Thayer,"" a character that he loves a lot and understands very well. And for this he'd like to thank the sensitive man who wrote the words, who's already been honored tonight, Ernest Thompson. And for the tremendous talent and guidance of our director Mark Rydell, he's very, very grateful. We all became like a family during the filming and we sort of stayed together since. People call him up and stay in touch and come to visit him, and so it's like we've stayed a family, and it's made my father very, very happy. And he wants to thank Marble Arch and Universal for their support of the movie ""On Golden Pond.""

 He also feels very lucky to have been able to spend a summer in such a beautiful part of our country, northern New Hampshire, and he wants to thank all the people there who were so friendly and welcoming to us. And he was very happy, and so was I and are we, to have had our two families together, the Haydens and the Fondas, on the beautiful shores of that lake so that we could get to know each other even more. He wishes my brother Peter were here tonight, but Peter is somewhere in the jungles of the Philippines in front of a camera right now, like a good Fonda. And I know that lastly, but really first, he is thanking Shirlee Fonda who has been his loving support for seventeen years, who he calls his Rock of Gibralter. I think she's his ""Ethel Thayer."" Dad, me and all the grandchildren are coming over with it right away. Thank you.

 Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Academy, you have bereft me of all words. But that's not good enough; I am custodian of this award for a lot of people. Let me say before continuing any further that I was overwhelmed to be mentioned in the same breath as the other four gentlemen who were nominated with me.

 This film was dedicated to Pandit Nehru, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, and Motilal Kothari, all men of great vision and courage. It was made by my friend Sir Richard Attenborough, another great man of vision and courage. And for all the men and women who worked on the film, this is an Oscar for vision, for courage, and for acting and for peace. Thank you.

 You know when you prepare a speech it's no use, cause it's all gone. I tried to get my kid to come up here to share this with me....

 But there are some special people I would like to share this with, specifically tomorrow is the seventeenth anniversary of my relationship with my one agent, Mr. Ed Bondy. They say marriages don't last. I've got a spirit that guides me, starting with my great-grandmother who died at the age of 117, and my mom and dad who I know are watching, and my cousin Yvonne*. Thank you, you make everything fall into place. And all you other four guys, this is ours [holding up the Oscar]. Thank you.

 Oh, boy! No matter how much you try to imagine what this is like, it's just so incredibly thrilling, right down to your toes. I have a lot of people to thank and I'm going to be one of those people that tries to mention a lot of names because I know just two seconds ago my mother and father went completely berserk and I'd like to give some other mothers and fathers that opportunity.

 I'd like to thank William Styron for creating this beautiful character and Alan Pakula for bringing it to the stage and allowing me to play it. I would like to thank Marty Starger and ITC for finding the financing for it. Nestor Almendros, the great cinematographer. Albert Wolsky, wonderful costumer. And the crew: Tommy Priestly, the Gerardos, the De Blau brothers, Tommy Prate, Chris Newman, Denny Maitland, Wally Props, Lillian, Alba, Dixie, Roy Helland. I'd like to thank my Polish coach Aline Bacho. My German coaches Anne Cattaneo and David Freedman. And the thirty-seven members of the American and European casts, whom I won't mention all of their names but for two. I feel like I owe them this because everything that I had I got from looking in their eyes and for the great love they gave me for five months. I thank Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol. And I thank you all very much.

I feel real lucky to have been a part of ""Tootsie,"" to have worked with actors like Charlie Durning and Dabney Coleman and Teri Garr, and to have had Sydney Pollack as my director and Dustin Hoffman as my leading lady. Oh, this is so exciting. I want to thank you all very, very much. This means so much to me. Thank you.

1983,56,"Dolly Parton, Sylvester Stallone",Actor in a Leading Role,Tender Mercies,Robert Duvall,"ROBERT DUVALL:
 Thank you very much. I'm very excited, very happy, very moved, very everything tonight, to be up here, to be singled out from among all these very talented people. I sometimes come to the Academy Awards and watch them year after year, and I get caught up in the spectacle of it, in the event, in the very complex type of entertainment and I guess, I know I forget, that what we're really here for is to single out who we think is the best for that given year. And if that's what I am to be this year then I appreciate it. I accept it with an honor and I'm very moved because of that.

 I think we set out to make a film, a very truthful film, a very good film. I think Bruce Beresford, Horton Foote, the Hobels, EMI, should all be commended for a very wonderful job that they did in putting this film together. I think it's a valid film, valid enough that we have gotten very much applause of a certain kind from certain members of the country western community, such as my friend Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings. And this is certainly a very high level of criticism coming from those people. And if I didn't have that on one hand, I would feel that this on the other hand was not complete. But the combination of both tonight makes this a very complete and exciting evening for me tonight. And I want to thank the Academy very much for this award. I'm very happy. Thank you.

 Well, thanks to the members of the Academy for this wonderful honor. Congratulations to John and Sam and Charles and Rip for your wonderful jobs. It's nice when you...the producer and the director and the writers are all one man -- Jim Brooks. He did everything for us on ""Terms of Endearment,"" including writing eleven versions of this speech. I was gonna say a lot about how much Shirley and Debra inspired me, but I understand they're planning an interpretive dance number later, right after the Best Actress award, explain everything about life. And I want to thank Mr. Diller. Hi to Shorty and Lorraine, my agent Sandy Bresler. All you rock people down at the Roxy and up in the Rockies, rock on. Thanks. I'm real proud.
"
1983,56,"Rock Hudson, Liza Minnelli",Actress in a Leading Role,Terms of Endearment,Shirley MacLaine,"SHIRLEY MacLAINE:
 I'm gonna cry because this show has been as long as my career. I have wondered for twenty-six years what this would feel like. Thank you so much for terminating the suspense. Oh my, I am nervous.

 I'm not going to thank everybody I've ever met in my entire life -- although, with the way my mind has been going lately probably everybody I've ever met in my entire life and in the other life I might have had had something to do with this. You know, if ""Terms of Endearment"" had happened to me five years ago, I think I would have called it a thrilling, commercial, artistic accident. But I don't believe that anymore. I don't believe there's any such thing as accident. I think that we all manifest what we want and what we need. I don't think there's any difference really between what you feel you have to do in your heart and success. They're inseparable.

 Jim Brooks deeply wanted to make a film about the defects and imperfections and foibles of people in a humorous and loving way. And he had such passion. It was unbelievable to watch. He's being very modest with himself tonight. It was unbelievable. His sense of truth was so accurate that he overwhelmed his own insecurities, and Paramount's. I guess we all did the same thing.

 I have wanted to work with the comic chemistry of Jack Nicholson since his chicken salad sandwich scene in ""Easy Pieces."" And to have him in bed was such middle-aged joy. I wanted to work with the turbulent brilliance of Debra Winger. She literally inhabited the character so thoroughly that I thought for four months I had two daughters.

 But in the end just let me say one thing. Films and life are like clay waiting for us to mold it. And when you trust your own insides, and that becomes achievement, it's a kind of a principle that seems to me is at work with everyone. God bless that principle. God bless that potential that we all have for making anything possible if we think we deserve it. I deserve this. Thank you.

1983,56,"Dyan Cannon, Gene Hackman",Actress in a Supporting Role,The Year of Living Dangerously,Linda Hunt,"LINDA HUNT:
 This is extraordinary. There was an Indonesian phrase in the film which translates into English as ""water from the moon."" And it means that which is unattainable, the impossible, that which one can never have or know. Making ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" for me was ""water from the moon.""

 I want to thank the members of the Academy so much for honoring me with this recognition and this encouragement at the beginning of my work in film, when I still have so much to learn about such a complex and a powerful medium. And I want to dedicate this to my parents and to Peter Weir, with much love. And to everyone I love who is out there watching tonight, here is the sign [kisses her thumb then holds it up]. Thank you.

 It would be a lie if I told you I didn't know what to say because I've been working on this speech for about twenty-five years. But you are not going to hear any of those speeches because none of the speeches were less than forty-five seconds.

 You know, it's easy to gamble everything when you've got nothing to lose, and Milos Forman had a great deal to lose when he gave these brilliant roles to Tom Hulce and me. And his courage became my inspiration. There's only one thing that's missing for me tonight and that is to have Tom Hulce standing by my side.

 [He steps away from the podium, then returns; music starts to play.] Wait a minute! Wait, I still have more time! [Laughs.] Half of this statue belongs to my beloved wife Kate. Thank you.

And I share this award to my friend Sam Waterston, Dith Pran, Sydney Schanberg, and also Pat Golden, that casting lady who found me for this role. And I thank Warner Bros. for helping me tell my story to the world, let the world know what happened in my country. And I thank God Buddah that tonight I'm even here. Thank you very much. Thank you.

 Oh, Benton, what you did for me; you changed my life, truly. This means so much more to me this time. I don't know why. I think the first time I hardly felt it because it was all so new. I owe a lot to the cast, to my players, to Lindsay and John and Danny and Ed and Amy and my little friends Gennie and Yankton. I owe a lot to my family for holding me together and loving me and having patience with this obsession of me. But I want to say thank you to you. I haven't had an orthodox career and I've wanted more than anything to have your respect. The first time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it. And I can't deny the fact that you like me. Right now, you like me! Thank you.

I know it would have been her dearest wish to be here with you all on this incredibly happy, joyous occasion for her, but I also know you understand the circumstances which prevented it.

 I personally would just like to say that I think it is so marvelous that after an illustrious career in the theater for so many years, Peggy should at last be visible to all those millions of moviegoers who are, have and will continue to enjoy her consummate artistry, her delicacy and beauty. That we should be able to share that all over the world with her in the movies is an enormous coup for all of us. Thank you.

 Well, thank Horton Foote for all this. I'm so glad that the members of the Academy responded to ""Carrie Watts"" the way I did, evidently. That's because the way he wrote it. And I want to thank you for this for all of us in the company: John Heard, and Carlin, and Richard Bradford, and Rebecca. And it was all through the beautiful eye of Fred Murphy and the masterful direction, and his film debut as a director, Peter Masterson. But mainly it's Horton's fault for all this. So I thank you all.

I really want to thank the actors branch of the Academy first, for just being a nominee with four actors that I really admire, and at least one that I consider a really good friend who I admire. And thank you for that. And for this fellow [the Oscar] from all of the Academy, I just want to share it with all the good work that was done by all the branches, whether you were nominated or not tonight, but this is all with you.

 A large part of this award belongs to Oliver Stone. And not only as the director, but having the courage to cast me in a part that not many people thought I could play. So I'll always be eternally grateful to him for that. And as a writer, Oliver, with Stanley Weiser, wrote a part that was the best part that I've ever had in my career. To Charlie and Martin Sheen, two wonderful actors that happen to be father and son, I thank them all very much for their help. Ed Pressman, Alex Ho, our producers; Leonard Goldberg, Scott Rudin, Tom Sherak of Fox, I thank you, too.

 I'd like to dedicate this award to William Darrid, Diana Douglas-Darrid, Anne Douglas and Kirk Douglas, my parents and step-parents, who have been extremely supportive and loving to me over the years. And in particular to my father, who I don't think ever missed one of my college productions, for his continued support and for helping a son step out of his shadow. I'll be eternally grateful to you, Dad, for that. Finally, to my wife Diandra and all my old friends who are smiling with me tonight, thank you. And to all you movie buffs, I just really appreciate, for making this a wonderful moment for me. Thank you. And good night, Cameron. I love you.

 Good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, friends and a few enemies...I don't think there is anyone aware—or unaware, rather—in Hollywood or the rest of the world tonight that this is the 60th anniversary of these Academy Awards. And I just realized myself the other day that my first, one and only attendance was thirty years ago. Patience truly is a virtue. But in winning this award it creates a certain dilemma, because I had decided if I had the good fortune to win that I would give it to my wife, who deserves it. But this evening I discovered backstage that they're worth fifteen thousand dollars...and now I'm not so sure. Cherie, I'm only kidding, it's yours. But if such a thing as a wish accompanied this award mine would be that we ended the writers' strike. And I thank you all sincerely.

I'd like to thank everyone I worked on with the movie [sic]. They were really fabulous. It was really a great experience for me. My makeup man, who had a lot to work with; my hairdresser; my assistant; my children, who've been so wonderful. The lady who taught me how to speak in this Brooklyn accent.

 And I would like to thank the women that I was nominated along with, because I feel really, really good because they were so great. And I would also like to thank Mary Louise Streep, who I feel so unbelievable that I did my first movie with her and now I was nominated with her, and I feel really thankful.

 My father so wanted to be here tonight. Ironically, a few weeks ago he joined the family of the disabled. And I understand that the hospital where he's at tonight, that a lot of people that I've met recently are gathered with him with tuxedos and champagne cups and formals. And they're all watching this show right now on a big TV that they rented. So to the...[applause]. It was just a few weeks ago that he was at the Golden Globes and he says, ""Let's find Gene Hackman."" Because he knows we're old roommates. ""C'mon, let's find Gene.""

I said, ""Great, sounds good. I'm in. Let's do it."" And then he actually wrote it.

 I'd like to thank the Academy for naming me in this group of most distinguished actors, the five nominees. I share this with you. I would like to thank John Cleese for writing this brilliant script, for his generosity, for his friendship. To my fellow actors, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis. To Jonathan Benson. To Charlie Crichton, who at seventy-seven proves that even with twenty or twenty-five years off there's no such thing as growing old when you've got a dream. He's the best.

And I'd like to thank all of my families, the tribes that I come from. The wonderful crew on ""The Accused,"" Jonathan Kaplan, Kelly McGillis, Tom Topor. Paramount, the Academy, my schools—thank my schools. And my family. All my brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers out there. And most importantly my mother Brandy, who taught me that all of my finger paintings were Picassos, and that I didn't have to be afraid.

But for everyone involved in the film, all our desire to make the film, all the strength that we needed, all the pleasure that we took in making the film came from Christy Brown.

My son said he was gonna make one of these out of clay for me, now I got the model for him. I want to thank my first agent, the late Ruth Aronson, who believed in me.

I'd like to thank Jim Sheridan and Shane Connaughton for the best script I've ever been involved in. I'd like to thank Noel Pearson for producing the film.

 I want to thank everybody who makes movies. I come from New York. As a little kid I lived in the projects, and you're the people I watched. You're the people wanted—made me want to be an actor. I'm so proud to be here. I'm proud to be an actor and I'm gonna keep on acting. And thank you so much.

 My God. I can't believe it. This is really unexpected. It's a great honor to be here, especially with such great actors like Nick Nolte and Warren Beatty and Robin Williams, Robert De Niro. First of all, before I say on, I want to say hello to my mother. She's in Wales watching this on television with Eve and Jean and Jill and Tony. My father died eleven years ago tonight, so maybe he had something to do with this as well, I don't know. But I want to say thank you to the Academy for your tremendous generosity. To my friend Bob Palmer, my friend and publicist. My dear, beloved wife Jenni. And I have many people to thank here in Los Angeles who over the years have given me tremendous support, without whose help I wouldn't be here, I know. And I am greatly honored and tremendously moved. And I—God bless you all. Thank you very much.

1991,64,Whoopi Goldberg,Actor in a Supporting Role,City Slickers,Jack Palance,"JACK PALANCE:
 Billy Crystal, [laughs] I crap bigger than him. You know, there are times when you reach a certain age plateau where the producers say, they talk about you and they say, ""Well, what do you think? Can we risk it? Can we do it? Can we use him?"" The other guy says, ""I don't know, let's look at some younger ones. We can make them look older, but this one, you know, it's kind of difficult."" They forget, they forget to ask that you go out there and you do all these…things. Like for instance, you know, [leaves podium] you go out there, you do these one-arm push-ups. [Does three one-arm push-ups on stage; returns to podium.] That's nothing, really. As far as the two-handed push-ups are concerned, you can do that all night and it doesn't make any difference whether she's there or not. And besides, it's a hell of a lot less expensive.

 Wow. You know, a long time ago in 1949, first picture, 1949, first film, I'd been shooting about two weeks and the producer came to me and he said, ""Jack"" – my name at that time was Vladimir, but he called me Jack. He says, ""Jack, you're going to win the Academy Award."" Can you believe it? Forty-two years later he was right. How the son of a bitch knew?! Thank you.

 This has been such an incredible year. And I'd like to dedicate this award to all of the women who came before me who never had the chances that I've had, and the survivors and the pioneers and the outcasts; and my blood, my tradition. And I'd like to thank all of the people in this industry who have respected my choices and who have not been afraid of the power and the dignity that that entitled me to.

 And I'd like to thank Ted Tally, and Thomas Harris, Jesse Kornbluth, everybody at Orion—the way it used to be, and the way it will always be in my heart. John Douglas and everybody at Quantico. The incredible cast and crew of ""Silence of the Lambs"" that Jonathan put together. And of course, the reason that I'm here, Anthony Hopkins. Quid pro quo, Doctor. And my guru, Jonathan Demme, not just for his talent but for his goodness; I promise you.

 And I'd like to thank my team of people, the only people I talk to every single day. My agent and friend, Joe Funicello, thank you. And Matt Saver, Pat Kingsley. I'd like to thank my family and my family of friends—the trusted ones, the circle. And most of all I'd like to thank my mother Brandy, my friend, the person who has loved me so much and so well that she taught me in inimitable ""Little Man Tate"" fashion to fly away. Thank you. And thank the Academy for embracing such an incredibly strong and beautiful feminist hero that I am so proud of. Thank you very much. Mike and Carol, you won the bet. Right on!

1991,64,Joe Pesci,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Fisher King,Mercedes Ruehl,"MERCEDES RUEHL:
 Thank you. I went to New York to study acting the summer that I was twenty-one. And like thousands of actors before me and thousands of actors after me, I went through the usual scores of moonlighting jobs, the usual scores of rejection, and the usual legions of prophets of doom who are always there and always at the ready to give you the up-to-minute odds against your ever making anything of yourself in this business. And at this moment, all of those sort of doleful memories have suddenly transformed themselves into nothing more than the sort of charming and amusing anecdotes for my memoirs! I cannot, cannot thank you enough.

 There are a few people I'd like to thank with all my heart, very quickly. The great Terry Gilliam. Richard LaGravenese, our screenwriter. An extraordinary cast; it was an honor to work with them. Roger Pratt, our cinematographer. Steve Randall, Lynda Obst, Debra Hill, Howard Feuer, Marsha McManus. My family and my close friends, for their patience and their respect and their support. And finally I would like to thank Albert Innaurato and the late Joseph Papp who gave me my first shot on the New York stage and my first break in the big time. And especially the late, great Joe Papp, who once in a rehearsal for that play nudged me out of the shadow and into the light and told me to stay there in no uncertain terms. I have. I do. I will. Thanks, Joe. Thank you.

1992,65,Jodie Foster,Actor in a Leading Role,Scent of a Woman,Al Pacino,"AL PACINO:
 You broke my streak. The last... I was at an affair recently—thank you so much for this by the way—I was at a ceremonial-type thing like this recently, and I didn't have a speech. I kept going into my pocket for a speech, but I never wrote one. But now I got one. It's here, and I should have had a little water before I got on because my mouth's dry. But I thank you and I just have to say...

 First, I don't know where he is in the house, I can't pick him out, but I got to thank him. I'm completely indebted to Marty Brest who directed the picture and who had such great love for this character I played. And that love is what he communicated to me every day, so I thank you, Marty, for that. I thank Bo Goldman, who wrote such a complicated, interesting, funny guy that could be and would be any actor's dream part. That part was so great. I thank Chris O'Donnell, my co-star in this. He made every day a pleasure for me. And I thank the wonderful support of cast and crew, of course. I also want to thank Tom Pollock and Casey Silver at Universal Pictures, and my agent Rick Nicita who urged me to do this part and actually threatened me if I didn't do it, 'cause I didn't want to do the part for some reason. Ira Lewis, my friend and my colleague, who helped me, Ira Lewis. And The Associated Blind for their generous support to me.

 If you'll indulge me for a minute—I'm just not used to this, so I had to write this down. I had this thought, and I thought if I ever got up here I would say it. I've been very lucky. I found desire for what I do early in my life and I'm lucky because I had people who encouraged that desire, from Lee Strasberg, to my great friend and mentor Charlie Laughton, to the great writers and filmmakers that I've been fortunate enough to work with. Now, recently a young girl came up to me. I was at a function for the South Bronx, which is where I'm from. And she said that I had encouraged her, and that's not necessarily by my work but just by the fact that we came from the same place. And I just can't forget that girl, and I can't forget the kids out there who may be thinking tonight that if he can do it, I can do it. So this is really a proud and hopeful moment for me, because I want to thank the Academy for giving us a gift of encouragement. And this is a gift, a great gift to me. I thank you all, really. Thank you.

It was a wonderful experience. I'd like to dedicate my part of this evening to my uncle Orin Hackman. He was a wonderful guy. Thank you very much.

1992,65,Anthony Hopkins,Actress in a Leading Role,Howards End,Emma Thompson,"EMMA THOMPSON:
 Ladies and gentlemen, I really don't know how to thank the Academy, not only for this [referring to the Oscar], but also for this view. Because it's overwhelming to see so many faces who've entertained and influenced me and thrilled me all my life, and it just takes my breath away. And if I could thank you all I would, but I have more pressing debts: to E. M. Forster, for creating ""Margaret Schlegel;"" to James Ivory, for asking me to play her; to Ismail Merchant, for paying me to play her, which feels very unnecessary at this moment. Actually, I think I might have to give back the money. And to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, for her flawless adaptation. To a superlative cast and crew. To Sony Pictures Classics, for their dedication and commitment. And especially to Sir Anthony Hopkins, for being, like this, the (k)night of my life. And finally I would like, if I may, to dedicate this Oscar to the heroism and the courage of women, and to hope that it inspires the creation of more true screen heroines to represent them. Thank you so much.

Of course I owe many, many thanks to the cast and crew of ""My Cousin Vinny,"" especially Mr. Joe Pesci for his endless support and great talent. And to the whole circle and the team, Suzan and Gina and Scott and Evelyn and Kate McGregor-Stewart and Francesco Pugliese. And my very brave family. Thank you very much.

1993,66,Emma Thompson,Actor in a Leading Role,Philadelphia,Tom Hanks,"TOM HANKS:
 Here's what I know. I could not be standing here without that undying love that was just sung about by, not Bruce [Springsteen], but Neil Young. And I have that in a lover that is so close to fine, we should all be able to experience such heaven right here on earth. I know also that, I should not be doing this, I should not be here, but I am because of the union of such filmmakers as Ed Saxon, Ron Nyswaner, Kristi Zea, Tak Fujimoto, Jonathan Demme -- who seems to have these [referring to the Oscar] attached to his limbs for every actor that works with him of late. And a cast that includes Antonio Banderas, who, second to my lover, is the only person I would trade for. And a cast that includes many other people, but the actor who really put his film image at risk, and shone because of his integrity, Mr. Denzel Washington, who I really must share this with.

 I would not be standing here if it weren't for two very important men in my life, so... two that I haven't spoken with in awhile, but I had the pleasure of just the other evening. Mr. Rawley Farnsworth, who was my high school drama teacher, who taught me to act well the part, there all the glory lies. And one of my classmates under Mr. Farnsworth, Mr. John Gilkerson. I mention their names because they are two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with, to fall under their inspiration at such a young age. I wish my babies could have the same sort of teacher, the same sort of friends.

 And there lies my dilemma here tonight. I know that my work in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names. They number a thousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight. They finally rest in the warm embrace of the gracious creator of us all. A healing embrace that cools their fevers, that clears their skin, and allows their eyes to see the simple, self-evident, common sense truth that is made manifest by the benevolent creator of us all and was written down on paper by wise men, tolerant men, in the city of Philadelphia two hundred years ago. God bless you all. God have mercy on us all. And God bless America.

 My thanks to the Academy for the very finest, greatest award that any actor can ever receive. The only thing a man can say at a time like this is: I am not really bald. Actually, I'm lucky enough to be working and for that I have to thank the boss, Bob Daly, the other boss, Terry Semel. Also Arnon Milchan, Steve Reuther, Arnold Kopelson, Andy Davis, Peter MacGregor-Scott, Michael Chapman. My friends Bill Jacobson and Michael Black. My dear, courageous family: Victoria, Kimberlea, and Austin Jones. Above all I thank the man who needs no support at all, Harrison Ford. For all of you, thanks for the work.

1993,66,Al Pacino,Actress in a Leading Role,The Piano,Holly Hunter,"HOLLY HUNTER:
 I'm so overwhelmed. To be with that group of actresses just slays me. When I was six years old I started pretending to play the piano on the window sills of my bedroom in the house where I grew up. And then after a while my parents realized that I wasn't going to stop, so they got me a cardboard keyboard to play to see if that might, you know, if I would get tired of that. But I wasn't. I didn't. And so then they got me a piano. So for the next ten years they let me have piano lessons. So I need to thank Eileen Parish, my first piano teacher, and I need to thank my parents for letting me have these lessons.

 And Jane Campion, I love you, I love you. Thank you so much for giving me a character and an experience that was so difficult to say good-bye to, except that I don't have to say good-bye to it because it's everybody's now. And that is such a gift. And Michael Nyman, who really gave me a veritable instruction manual for a way into ""Ada McGrath"" by giving the music, giving me the music that he gave me and the entire movie to experience. And Jan Chapman, our producer, for being so luminous and for giving ""The Piano"" and all of us a place to flourish. Harvey and Bob Weinstein, you also break my heart with your uncensored passion and support for this movie. And just thank you all so much for letting this movie in. And thanks.

1994,67,Holly Hunter,Actor in a Leading Role,Forrest Gump,Tom Hanks,"TOM HANKS:
 Thank you. I'm standing here in lieu of my fellow nominees who are just as deserving, if not more so, of this moment. I'm standing here because of an army of people who over the course of a back-breaking schedule that was set by Bob Zemeckis -- who worked much harder than I did and had much more at risk if our efforts were not successful. I'm empowered to stand here thanks to the ensemble of actors, men and women who I shared the screen with, who in ways that they will never understand made me a better actor. And I am standing here because the woman I share my life with has taught me and demonstrates for me every day just what love is.

 I -- man, I feel as though I'm standing on magic legs in a special effects process shot that is too unbelievable to imagine and far too costly to make a reality. But here is my mark, and there is where I'm supposed to look. And believe me, the power and the pleasure and the emotion of this moment is a constant the speed of light. It will never be diminished, nor will my appreciation and the meaning between two simple words that I can only offer you here: Thank you. God bless you in this room and God bless you all around the world.

Thanks, Tim, for giving me the part of my life -- Gil Cates, don't put music on, because if it's a ""Mission Impossible"" theme I'll get very angry. Larry and Scott, thanks for a great script. The Disney people, for, well for doing it in the first place. I think everyone who saw the movie is in this room tonight. Thank you for their support. Johnny Depp, thank you for your talent, your professionalism, your goodness. A great cast down the line. It gave me a chance to work with my daughter for the first time. Rick, Ve and Yolanda, who have already won an award tonight, for making it all possible for me.

 The members of the press, particularly Rod Lurie who is my number one fan in the press and has been an avid supporter for years. My team of long standing: Peter Bennett*, Stan Lushell*, Mike Mamakos. My agents who are here tonight: Fred Westheimer, Ames Cushing. My gifted daughters, Susie and Juliet Landau. My best friend Gretchen Becker, who's here, who's talented. My sister Connie, who's doing battle with leukemia right now and winning that battle.

 I want to thank the Academy so much. This is such a wonderful honor, especially for a little film that seemed to have no future. And it's just such a great honor. I want to thank Orion Films, past and present, especially Marc Platt for letting us do this very peculiar little film in the first place. And my dear friend Lynn Arost, the producer, who really stuck by the film even when it was sitting on a shelf in a bank vault in New York City. To the writers of course, who created a marvelous character. To the players, a wonderful group of actors that I was fortunate to work with, especially Mr. Tommy Lee Jones who really made the performance that I gave possible. This is really a tribute to Tony Richardson. He loved actors. He loved everything about it. He loved the acting, and he was the perfect person for me to work with. He just kept nudging me over the edge, and with a character like this it's exactly what I needed. And last of all, to my three children, who make all of this possible with their love and patience. So thank you very, very much.

 I'm so privileged to be in the company of these gifted women, including Jennifer Tilly, my colleague, who's so wonderful. I'm in debt to my loyal friend and remarkable artist, Woody Allen. He gave me such a gift with this role. And with this gift came acting with John Cusack, being lit by the great cinematographer Carlo Di Palma, costumed by Jeffrey Kurland, working with Santo Loquasto, a great cast, a great crew. My thanks also to Tracey Jacobs, Bobby Greenhut, Jean Doumanian, and Harvey and Bob Weinstein. I have to thank my family: Martha, Harris Yulin, Kathleen Tolan, my brothers Greg and Donny, Clarice, the Steve Tesiches, Arlene Donovan, and my sweet daughters and their sweet patience, Emily and Lily, without whom nothing is anything.

I have got to thank the members of the Academy for this, for including me in this group of super talents and for helping me blur the line between art and commerce with this award. I know it's not hip to say it, but I just love acting, and I hope that there'll be more encouragement for alternative movies where we can experiment and fast forward into the future of acting.

 Let me thank the awesome, multi-talented Mike Figgis. My incredible, amazing co-star Elisabeth Shue. I am going to share this award with both of you and the late John O'Brien, whose spirit moved me so much. Tony Dingman, Annie Stewart -- the producers, Annie Stewart and Stuart Regen, everyone at MGM/UA and Lumiere. I'd like to thank Ed Limato, my colleagues Gerry Harrington, Jeff Levine, Richard Lovett.

And I've always been very cryptic about my answer, but tonight I'm going to tell you who ""Keyser Soze"" is for me. The person who pulls the strings, the person who manipulates, who hovers over us, who gives us life and breath. For me ""Keyser Soze"" is Bryan Singer, the director of this film. And I thank him for his friendship, and for giving me an extraordinary part, and for making me a better actor than I ever thought I could be. I've dreamed of a moment like this my whole life. I thank my manager Joanne, my agent Brian Gersh. And on a personal note to my mother, I'm so proud that you can be here tonight. Thank you so much -- [applause].

Sam Cohn, my dear friend Elaine Goldsmith, Arlene Donovan, you should be so happy because this would not have happened without you. Big thanks to Martha Luttrell and Nancy Seltzer for their support.

All those mothers and fathers without whose strong performances the film would not have been as balanced and had as much dignity as it did, I thank you for that. Big thanks to Sean Penn for your intelligence and your courage and your humor, and your hair-do. It was a great dance. Thank you so much.

 To my kids, Eva, Jack Henry, and Miles. Thanks for being such good sports, and who were in the movie and did a great job.

There's a game you can play where you create a dinner party where you can invite guests from any time in history, real or fictional.

I can't quite imagine where the conversation might head that night, but it has really enriched me as an actor to be seated at that table.

My darling wife Jane, I wouldn't be standing here without you, and to Merle and John, my mum and stepdad in Queensland. And to the unstoppable David Helfgott. The front of my script said that this story was inspired by the events of your life. You truly are an inspiration.

 It is impossible to maintain one's composure in this situation. What am I doing here? Especially considering the extraordinary group of women with whom I was nominated. We five women were fortunate to have the choice, not just the opportunity but the choice, to play such rich, complex female characters. And I congratulate producers like Working Title and Polygram for allowing directors to make autonomous casting decisions based on qualifications and not just market value. And I encourage writers and directors to keep these really interesting female roles coming, and while you're at it you can throw in a few for the men as well.

 My family, friends and colleagues here tonight and all around the world, they know exactly who they are, you know who you are. And I hope you already know how much your support and your care means to me, but I'm gonna name three. The co-writer/director and producer of ""Fargo,"" Mr. Ethan Coen, who helped make an actor of me. His brother, Mr. Joel Coen, who made a woman of me.

Thank you, Ben and Matt -- I still want to see some ID. Thank you, Gus Van Sant, for being so subtle you're almost subliminal.

And I want to thank Marsha for being the woman who lights my soul on fire every morning. God bless you. And most of all, I want to thank my father, up there, the man who when I said I wanted to be an actor, he said, ""Wonderful, just have a back-up profession like welding."" Thank you. God bless you.

1997,70,Geoffrey Rush,Actress in a Leading Role,As Good as It Gets,Helen Hunt,"HELEN HUNT:
 The first time I saw ""Mrs. Brown"" -- saw it three times. The first time I saw it, I leaned over to my beloved and said, ""She's [Judi Dench] going to win an Academy Award."" And in my mind tonight she has. And so has Julie Christie, and so has Helena Bonham Carter, and so has Kate Winslet. And for that matter so has Billy Connolly, and so has Ben Affleck, and so has Joan Allen. And I am honored to work in a year when there were so many magnificent performances.

 I am here for one reason and that's Jim Brooks. One single reason, and that's the only reason really. That's the only reason. I thank -- I am tired of thanking you -- I thank God for giving me a little piece of you. Jack, I worship you, you know it. Greg, I hope you hold in your heart how beautiful your performance in this movie was. I would like to thank our producers Bridget Johnson, Kristi Zea, Larry Mark. Everyone at Sony. The team of experts it took to make me available for this movie. My acting teachers Lurene Tuttle, wherever you are, Gordon Hunt, Larry Moss, Gary Austin, for giving me a way to learn about myself and the world, and a way to express myself. I hate to think who I would be without that. My parents, who are sobbing at this point. My friends, who are at home jumping up and down. And you [Hank Azaria], the very, just the very best man I know. Thank you so much. This is a magnificent honor. Thank you very much.

 Thank you! This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English. I don't know! I am not able to express all my gratitude, because now, my body is in tumult because it is a colossal moment of joy so everything is really in a way that I cannot express. I would like to be Jupiter! And kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making love to everybody, because I don't know how to express. It's a question of love. You are really -- this is a mountain of snow, so delicate, the suavity and the kindness, it is something I cannot forget, from the bottom of my heart. And thank you for the Academy Awards for the, who really loved the movie. Thank you to all in Italy, for the Italian cinema, grazie al Italia who made me. I am really, I owe to them all my, if I did something good. So grazie al Italia e grazie al America, land of the lot of things here. Thank you very much.

See, some of them you do for money, some of them you do for love. This is a love child. Paul Schrader put together -- Paul and Nick actually put together ""Affliction."" I mean, it was a beautiful script. We had an extraordinary cast -- Nick, Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafoe, Mary Beth Hurt -- in a screenplay second to none. I'd like to thank all of those people. Plus Linda Reisman produced it for us. Largo paid for it. Lions Gate released it. I'd like to thank Hilly Elkins, my manager, and Bobby Littman, my agent, my publicists Delson and Weissman. I'd like to say thanks to all the people up in Santa Barbara where I'm working on a thing called ""Atticus."" Thank you, gang, for giving me Monday off. My kids, I say thanks to my kids...

 I would like to thank the Academy from the bottom of my heart. I would like to thank Emily Watson, and Fernanda Montenegro, and my friend Cate Blanchett, and the greatest one who ever was, Meryl Streep. I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence.

 But I would like to thank Harvey Weinstein and everybody at Miramax Films for their undying support of me. I would like to -- I wouldn't be in this auditorium, let alone up here, if it wasn't for two incredibly talented men. Our director John Madden, thank you so much for all that you gave me. You are so inspiring. And to my soulful partner, Joseph Fiennes, who I share this with. I wouldn't be here without him. I would like to thank the rest of our miraculous cast and crew. Our producers Donna Gigliotti and David Parfitt -- I didn't forget you this time! Especially Jim Magill and Sophie Shand and my friend Ben Affleck. I would like to thank my wonderful agent Rick Kurtzman who is a beautiful man and a wonderful agent and in his case that is not an oxymoron. I would like to thank Harold Brown, Stuart Gelwarg*, and Stephen Huvane.

 I would not have been able to play this role had I not understood love of a tremendous magnitude, and for that I thank my family. My mother Blythe Danner, who I love more than anything, and my brother Jake Paltrow, who is just the dearest person in the whole world. My earthly guardian angel, Mary Wigmore*. And especially to my father Bruce Paltrow, who has surmounted insurmountable obstacles this year. I love you more than anything in the world. And to my grandpa Buster, who almost made it here tonight, but couldn't quite get here. Grandpa, I want you to know that you have created a beautiful family who loves you and loves each other more than anything, and we thank you for that.

 I would like to dedicate this to two young men who lost their lives very early. Harrison Kravis and my cousin Keith Paltrow. We miss you very much. And I thank you. Thank you so much, everybody!

1998,71,Robin Williams,Actress in a Supporting Role,Shakespeare in Love,Judi Dench,"JUDI DENCH:
 I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a little bit of him. I do thank the Academy very much indeed. I do think also that the best bit about the Academy Awards is being nominated. You live in a kind of haze for several weeks, and the terrible thing is that somebody's got to win. My heart goes out to all the other four who didn't. And also, my admiration.

 I do have to thank John Madden and Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, as I actually wrote to John Madden after ""Mrs. Brown"" and said, I will do anything in your next film. If you want somebody to slouch in a doorway, you can count on me. And I mean it, and I hope he bears me in mind next time. I do thank you all very much indeed. I am very moved by it. Thank you.

1999,72,Gwyneth Paltrow,Actor in a Leading Role,American Beauty,Kevin Spacey,"KEVIN SPACEY:
 This is the highlight of my day. I hope it is not all downhill from here. I first have to say that I would like to dedicate this to the man who inspired my performance. A man who has been my friend and my mentor, and since my father died, a little bit like my father, whose performance in ""The Apartment"" stands as one of the finest we've ever had. Jack Lemmon, wherever you are, thank you, thank you, thank you.

 To my friends, for pointing out my worst qualities. I know you do it because you love me. And that's why I loved playing ""Lester,"" because we got to see all of his worst qualities and we still grew to love him. This movie to me is all about how any single act from any single person put out of context is damnable. But the joy of this movie is that it is real beauty. We found real beauty in this extraordinary script by Sam Mendes -- by Alan Ball. It feels like he wrote it though, doesn't it?

 I am very proud to be an actor, and I have tried very hard to protect my work; and I am stunned and a bit speechless. And Dianne, thank you for teaching me about caring about the right things, and I love you. And Mother, I don't care what they say about bringing you to award shows. I will always bring you to award shows because I'm proud of you and I love you. And thank you, thank you, thank you.

1999,72,Judi Dench,Actor in a Supporting Role,The Cider House Rules,Michael Caine,"MICHAEL CAINE:
 Thank you, thank you. I was looking [gesturing to the monitor], watching all the others, and thinking back when I saw the performances and I was thinking of how the Academy changed ""The winner is..."" to ""The Oscar goes to..."". And if ever there was a category where the Oscar goes to someone without there being a winner, it's this one. Because I do not feel like being the winner. You have Michael, who I'd never heard of quite frankly, who is astonishing. You have Jude, who is going to be a big star no matter what happens. You have Tom, who if you had won this your pot price would have gone down so fast. Have you any idea what supporting actors get paid? And we only get one motorhome, a small one. And Haley Osment, what an astonishing... where is he? There he is. Haley, when I saw you I thought, well that's me out of it. So really, I'm basically up here, guys, to represent you as what I hope you will all be, a survivor.

 I want to -- I've got to hurry up or they... Dick [Zanuck], I wasn't here last time, so give me a bit with my speech, the last time I won, so give me a bit extra time, okay? I want to thank Harvey and Bob Weinstein and Meryl Poster at Miramax. Lasse Hallström, an extraordinary director, and Richard Gladstein. The wonderful actors I worked with: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker -- all people who inhabit rather than act. And the wonderful children that I acted with there. And last of all, I want to thank my two daughters, Dominique and Natasha, and my wife. Thank you.

 Thank you, thank you so much. We have come a long way. To think that this movie wouldn't have been made three-and-a-half years ago, and we made it now for under two million dollars. And now this. It's quite remarkable. I want to thank the Academy for their support and recognition of me and my work in a movie that is so important, and I am so proud to be a part of it.

 This movie would have never been made -- I had, just on the off chance that I got up here, I brought this piece of paper because I knew I couldn't forget anyone, because everyone put their heart and soul into this movie and God knows no one got paid. So first, Kimberly Peirce, for her fierce tenacity and vision. Andy Bienen, our co-writer. Killer Films, you guys always make important movies and I thank you for that. John Hart, Jeff Sharp, for being there for me every single minute. Jim Denault, our cinematographer, who was absolutely brilliant. Kerry Barden, Jennifer McNamara, for fighting for me, the casting directors. Chloë Sevigny, the rest of the cast, who portrayed their characters so honestly and brilliantly. Lee Percy, our editor.

 I want to thank Michael Stremel, Lindsay Law and Bill Mechanic and everyone at Fox Searchlight for putting their wing around this small, little movie and giving us wings. Larry Moss, my acting coach, who, without him, I could have never given this performance. Thank you, Larry. My mom, who's up there somewhere [in the balcony]. It looks like living out of our car was worth it. Holly Hein, for keeping my head on straight. My publicist Troy Nankin, who is a beautiful, beautiful human being. Kami Putnam, I have to thank you for fighting for me. I'm almost done, I promise. The Independent Film Channel, for helping us finish our movie. And Hylda Queally and David Wirtschafter, for their support.

 And last, but certainly not least, I want to thank Brandon Teena for being such an inspiration to us all. His legacy lives on through our movie to remind us to always be ourselves, to follow our hearts, to not conform. I pray for the day when we not only accept our differences, but we actually celebrate our diversity. Thank you very much.

 Whew! My grandfather's name was Stan Wemyss. He was a cinematographer in the second World War. My uncle David, David William Crowe, he died last year at the age of sixty-six. I'd like to thank the Academy for something which is pretty surprising and dedicate it to two men who still continue to inspire me. I'd also like to thank my mum and dad, who I just don't thank enough, I suppose.

 And an incredible cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Moeller, Spencer Treat Clark, the magnificent Richard Harris, the late Oliver Reed, Tomas Arana, Tommy Flanagan, Derek Jacobi and everybody else. DreamWorks, a great company and a vital and andrenalized contributor to the art form. To Doug Wick, David Franzoni, Bruno Lustig and Terry Needham, and a very brave crew collected from twenty-two different countries around the world. To the people that work for me, who work with me, my personal cavalry: George Freeman, Alan Hergott, Larry Witzer, Shirley Pearce, Robin Baum, Mark Dumbrell. But really folks, you know, I owe this to one bloke and his name is Ridley Scott. You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland, or Newcastle like Ridley or Jamie Bell, or the suburbs of anywhere, you know, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable. But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imagining[s]. And for anybody who's on the down side of advantage and relying purely on courage, it's possible. Thanks very much.

And sir [speaking to music conductor Bill Conti], you're doing a great job, but you're so quick with that stick. So why don't you sit, 'cause I may never be here again.

 I would like to start with telling you all how amazing the experience of feeling the sisterhood of being included in a group with Joan Allen and Juliette Binoche and Laura Linney and Ellen Burstyn for these last weeks has been. It's just felt like such a triumph to me to be in that list. My name starts with ""R"" so I'm always last, but I still love the list. But I can't believe this, this is so [looking at the Oscar]... this is quite pretty.

 I want to acknowledge so many people that made ""Erin Brockovich,"" ""Erin Brockovich"" -- but let me make my dress pretty [adjusts the train of her dress]. Universal, everybody at Universal, Kevin Misher and Stacey Snider and Stacey Sher -- and I can't believe I'm remembering everybody's name. Jersey Films, Danny DeVito, and everybody over there. Everyone I've ever met in my life. This movie was sinfully fun to make, and Albert Finney is my friend and my pleasure to act with. And Aaron Eckhart and Scotty and Gemmenne and Brittany and Ashley, all the wonderful actors that played my children. And Marg Helgenberger -- and turn that clock off, it's making me nervous. Greg Jacobs, everybody on our crew that was so great. And, well, just a few other people... But really, the main person -- well, Richard LaGravenese and Susannah Grant who wrote such a nice script.

 Steven Soderbergh -- hi, there you are -- you truly just made me want to be the best actor that I suppose I never knew I could be, or aspire to. And I made every attempt -- Stick-man, I see you. So I thank you for really making me feel so... [laughs!] I love it up here! Yeah, anyway, I start working for him again in two days, so I can get to you later. But Benjamin Bratt, my sister Lisa, my brother-in-law Tony. Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who's been my agent since God was a boy. Jeff Berg. My mom!

I'll always be following in your footsteps. There's nothing I would rather do, sir. Nothing I would rather do. God bless you. God bless you.

 I want to thank the Academy. You know, when I was in college first starting out as an actor, they asked each one of us what we wanted to do. I said I want to be the best actor in the world. All the students in the classroom looked at me like I was a nut. Life has taught me to just try and be the best that I can be, and I thank the Academy for saying to me that on this given night I was the best that I could be. I want to thank Warner Bros. and Alan Horn and Lorenzo di Bonaventura for supporting this film. And Antoine Fuqua, a brilliant young filmmaker, African-American filmmaker.

 I haven't really written a speech because every time I wrote a speech for the past one of these things I didn't win. But, you know, there comes a time in life when everything seems to make sense and this is not one of those times. What I do know, though, is that I've never felt this much love and encouragement from my peers and from people I admire and from complete strangers. And it means a great deal to me. And if it weren't for the insomnia and those sudden panic attacks, this has been an amazing, amazing journey.

 I have to thank--they're already flashing time's up--I have to thank my mother and father, most importantly, for all the creativity and the encouragement. And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.

 What can I say? This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman. And this is a tribute to his survival. I'd like to thank Roman Polanski for the role of a lifetime. And for those of you who have seen the film and sat through the credits, you know there are just too many people to thank individually. I would not be here without all their efforts. And I thank them. And everyone worked extremely hard to make this film. And I have to thank Focus Features for getting us out there. To my longtime friend, manager, agent, consigliere, Joanne Colonna. Everybody at The Firm, PMK/HBH. And you know...[music plays]. Wait one second. One second, please, one second. Cut it out, cut it out. I get one shot at this. I'm sorry. I didn't say more than five names I don't think, but...

 This is, you know, it fills me with great joy, but I am also filled with a lot of sadness tonight because I'm accepting an award at such a strange time. And, you know, my experiences in making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people at times of war, and the repercussions of war. And whomever you believe in, if it's God or Allah, may He watch over you. And let's pray for a peaceful and swift resolution. Thank you. And I have a friend from Queens who's a soldier in Kuwait right now, Tommy Zarabinski. And I hope you and your boys make it back real soon. God bless you, guys. I love you. Thank you very much.

 I do have to say it was, why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honor that. And it is a tradition that needs to be upheld. At the same time you say there is a lot of problems in the world. And since 9/11 there's been a lot of pain, in terms of families losing people, and now with the war, families losing people. And God bless them.

 Thank you so much, the Academy. To be nominated with such amazing women in an amazing year for women, thank you very much. Everyone involved in ""Chicago."" There's so many people. Rob Marshall, Harvey Weinstein, Craig, Neil, everybody, and all the cast and crew.

 Everybody in Swansea, South Wales, I love you. And to my son Dylan, who is going to be watching at home, and to my husband, who I love and I share this award with you, along with this one, too, thank you so much.
"
2003,76,Nicole Kidman,Actor in a Leading Role,Mystic River,Sean Penn,"SEAN PENN:
 Thank you. If there's one thing that actors know--other than that there weren't any WMDs--it's that there is no such thing as ""best"" in acting. And that's proven by these great actors that I was nominated with, as well as the Giamattis, Cages, Downey Jrs., Nicholsons, etc., that were not nominated. We know how great all of you were. My daughter Dylan and son Hopper find it presumptuous and embarrassing to write a speech, and so I'm gonna give it a go without. God, I really thank Clint Eastwood professionally and humanly for coming into my life. The great, great cast that I had to work with, my friends. Where do you go? Dennis Lehane, Brian Helgeland. Ma. Dad. Robin, for being an undying emotional inspiration on this roller coaster I'm learning to enjoy. Thank you all very much.

I'd like to thank my fellow nominees, who are all spectacular, and I want to work with all of you in a movie at some point. Dennis Lehane, Brian Helgeland for the writing of this amazing script. Clint Eastwood, you're so great. You're such an amazing director. And you're making my mantel very crowded. Thank you. It's due to you, sir. My fellow cast members: Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Laurence Fishburne. The crew was fantastic. Toni Howard, Lisa Kasteler, Alan Horn, Bruce Berman, Jeff Robinov, and from Warner Bros. Joe Hyams. Judie Hoyt, Rob Lorenz. My mom and dad. Dave, Adele, Gabi, Terry--hang in there. You can kick it. Geiss family, your dad's smiling down on you. Susan, I love you so much. Eva, Jack, Miles, thanks for being there for me. Susan, thanks for being the best friend one could have. The Actors' Gang in ""Embedded"" in New York, thank you so much for putting up with me being here.

 And I would like to say one more thing. In this movie I play a victim of abuse and violence, and if you are out there and are a person that has had that tragedy befall you, there is no shame and no weakness in seeking help and counseling. It is sometimes the strongest thing that you can do to stop the cycle of violence. Thank you.

All of our producers, Brad, Clark, Meagan, Mark, Donald, Sammy Lee, everybody at Media 8, Bob and everybody at Newmarket, thank you so much for working so hard on this film.

And I have to thank my incredible partner in crime. You're one hell of a partner to have. Thank you so much for standing by me. And my mom.

Vincent D'Onofrio, for teaching me how to work. Tom Cruise, for showing me that, very early on, kindness and success are not mutually exclusive. And finally and most importantly in my life, my glorious family, my immigrant mom and dad. Thank you for never saying ""don't try."" My brother, who I love so much, and his new wife, who clapped the loudest and laughed the loudest. I love you so much. Nanci Ryder, who's always there. And my beloved John Carrabino. Thank you for sharing this journey with me, every day of it. Without you there would be none of this. Thank you for dreaming so much bigger than I would ever dare to dream and for making me believe. I love you. This is for you. Thank you.

 I got so many people to thank tonight. And first I'm going to start it out with Taylor Hackford. Taylor, you took a chance, man. I mean that love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. And it's cracked open and it's spilling, and everybody's drowning in this love. I thank you for taking a chance on this film. And thank you for waiting fifteen years to get me to do it. I want to thank you; I want to thank Crusader.

 I want to thank my agents. I want to thank Rick Kurtzman. I want to thank Kim Hodgert. I want to thank Steve Smooke. I want to thank my managers Jaime King and Marcus King. Let's live this African-American dream. It's beautiful. I'm glad I'm with you and I ain't never leaving you. So I love you.

 I got a chance to meet a whole lot of people, experiencing this. And other people I want to thank, I want to thank my sister; four foot eleven of nothing but pure love. I want to thank my daughter for telling me just before I got up here, ""If you don't win, Dad, you're still good.""

 I see Oprah and I see Halle and I just want to say your names. I want to talk to you later. Both of you. Because Oprah allowed me to meet somebody by the name of Sidney Poitier. And Sidney Poitier said [mimicking his voice], ""I saw you once. And I looked in your eyes and there was a connection."" And he says, ""I give to you responsibility."" So I'm taking that responsibility tonight. And thank you, Sidney.

 This is probably going to be the toughest part of this speech. My daughter shares my grandmother's name: Marie. My grandmother's name is Estelle Marie Talley. And she's not here tonight. And this is going to be the toughest part. But she was my first acting teacher. She told me, ""Stand up straight. Put your shoulders back. Act like you got some sense."" We would go places and I would wild out, and she says, ""Act like you've been somewhere."" And then when I would act the fool, she would beat me. She would whup me. And she could get an Oscar for the way she whupped me because she was great at it. And after she whipped me, she would talk to me and tell me why she whipped me, said, ""I want you to be a southern gentleman."" And she still talks to me now; only now she talks to me in my dreams. And I can't wait to go to sleep tonight because we got a lot to talk about. I love you.

And a working actor, for that matter. And now, this. I thank the Academy. I am eternally grateful for this great honor. I would also like to acknowledge my fellow nominees. Annette, Imelda, Kate and Catalina, your work inspires me beyond words.

 I am going to start by thanking my husband because I'd like to think I learn from past mistakes. Chad, you're my everything. Thank you for your support. It means the world. I would never be standing here if it weren't for each and every one of the brilliant people I had surrounding me, supporting me and believing in me. Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, thank you for sending me this most marvelous script. You will never know how grateful I am. Paul Haggis, for writing this beautiful script. Our other producers extraordinaire: Al Ruddy, Clint, Rob Lorenz. Phyllis Huffman, our casting director. My trainers, Grant Roberts and Héctor Roca, you pushed me further than I ever thought I could push myself, up to that last pound, actually to that last ounce. I thank you. My sparring partners who were so patient. And everyone at Gleason's. Well, the ever-amazing Morgan Freeman. Tom Stern, our cinematographer, you are brilliant. Joel Cox, our editor, you're amazing. You know? I'm going to thank my mom for believing in me from the beginning; my dad for his support. My agents: Josh Lieberman, Tony Lipp, Kelly Tiffan, John Campisi. Jason Weinberg, my manager. [Music begins to play.] Uh uh, you can't do that, because I haven't gotten to Clint yet. I saved him for the end. Karl Austen, Jeff Bernstein, my lawyers.

 And then... Clint. Clint Eastwood, thank you for allowing me to go on this journey with you. Thank you for believing in me. You're my ""Mo Cuishle."" Thank you.

 Alan Horn and Warner Bros., as well, thank you. [Music starts up again.] And you know what? Wait! Troy Nankin! Troy Nankin, my best friend and publicist! Thank you!

 Thank you very much. Thank you to the Academy who know Katharine Hepburn so well and is so intimately acquainted with her work. This is an indescribable surprise and honor. Thank you.

 I know you think it's cheesy, sweetheart, but I have to thank you, my husband. And Hylda Queally and Robyn Gardiner, my uber-agents. And the wonderful Lisa Kasteler. Everyone involved in ""The Aviator."" When you play someone as terrifyingly well-known as Katharine Hepburn, it's a collaborative effort; you need as much help as you can get. And thank you, of course, to Miss Hepburn. The longevity of her career, I think, is inspiring to everyone. But most importantly, and on behalf of everyone I know in ""The Aviator,"" thank you to Martin Scorsese. I hope my son will marry your daughter. Thank you.

 And my mom's name is Marilyn O'Connor, and she's here tonight. And I'd like if you see her tonight to congratulate her, because she brought up four kids alone and she deserves a congratulations for that. Ah, we're at the party, ma, you know? And she took me to my first play and she stayed up with me and watched the NCAA final four, and my passions, her passions became my passions. And, you know, be proud, mom, because I'm proud of you and we're here tonight and it's so good. Thank you.

 Wow. Wow. Alright, so I'm not winning Director. It's a funny thing about winning an Academy Award, this will always be sort of synonymous with your name from here on in. It will be: Oscar winner George Clooney, Sexiest Man Alive 1997, Batman, died today in a freak accident....

 Listen, I don't quite know how you compare art. You look at these performances this year, of these actors, and unless we all did the same role—everybody put on a bat suit, we'll all try that—unless we all did the same role, I don't know how you compare it. They are stellar performances and wonderful work, and I'm honored, truly honored to be up here.

 And finally, I would say that, you know, we are a little bit out of touch in Hollywood every once in a while, I think. It's probably a good thing. We're the ones who talked about AIDS when it was just being whispered, and we talked about civil rights when it wasn't really popular. And we, you know, we bring up subjects, we are the ones—this Academy, this group of people gave Hattie McDaniel an Oscar in 1939 when blacks were still sitting in the backs of theaters. I'm proud to be a part of this Academy, proud to be part of this community, and proud to be out of touch. And I thank you so much for this.

2005,78,Jamie Foxx,Actress in a Leading Role,Walk the Line,Reese Witherspoon,"REESE WITHERSPOON:
 Oh my goodness. I never thought I'd be here in my whole life, growing up in Tennessee. I want to say that Johnny Cash and June Carter had a wonderful tradition of honoring other artists and musicians and singers, and I really feel that tradition tonight. It is very important and I really feel it, so I want to thank the Academy for this incredible honor.

 I want to say thank you to so many people who helped me create this role. Everyone at Fox; Cathy Konrad, James Keach for producing the film. A very special thank you to Jim Mangold who directed the film and also wrote this character who is a real woman who has dignity and honor and fear and courage. And she's a real woman and I really appreciate that. It was an incredible gift that you gave me, so thank you. And T Bone Burnett for helping me realize my lifelong dream of being a country music singer; thank you, T Bone. And I want to say thank you to Joaquin Phoenix who just put his heart and soul into this performance. His commitment and passion for this character and for this performance was just remarkable and I feel so lucky to have gone on this journey with you.

 I am so blessed to have my family here tonight. My mother and my father are here. And I just want to say thank you so much for everything, for being so proud of me. It didn't matter if I was making my bed or making a movie, they never hesitated to say how proud they were of me and that means so very much to a child. So thank you, Mom and Dad. I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband and my two children—who should be going to bed—and thank you for loving me so much and supporting me. And I want to say that my grandmother was one of the biggest inspirations in my life. She taught me how to be a real woman, to have strength and self respect, and to never give those things away. And those are a lot of qualities I saw in June Carter. And people used to ask June how she was doing, and she used to say: ""I'm just trying to matter."" And I know what she means. You know, I'm just trying to matter and live a good life and make work that means something to somebody. And you have all made me feel that I might have accomplished that tonight. So thank you so much for this honor.

 Thank you so much to the Academy for this tremendous, tremendous honor. I share it with others: Ralph Fiennes, my luminous acting partner; Fernando Meirelles, our director, who is brimming over with such humanity; and our dignified, sensitive producer, Simon Channing Williams; and of course, John le Carré, who wrote this unflinching, angry story. And he really paid tribute to the people who are willing to risk their own lives to fight injustice, and they're greater men and women than I. But thank you, thank you so much. Thank you.

2006,79,Reese Witherspoon,Actor in a Leading Role,The Last King of Scotland,Forest Whitaker,"FOREST WHITAKER:
 Thank you. Thank you. Just a second, just a second. Okay. Take it [in], okay. I wrote something down because I thought if it would happen I would be a little overwhelmed and I am. So, okay.

 When I was a kid the only way that I saw movies was from the backseat of my family's car at the drive-in, and it wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies. So receiving this honor tonight tells me that it's possible, it is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in South Central L.A., in Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen. Because when I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us. Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it's a connection so strong, it's a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.

 So I want to thank my fellow believers in ""The Last King of Scotland."" I want to thank Peter, Jeremy, Andrea, Lisa, Charles, Kevin, James McAvoy, Kerry, Stephen, Fox, DNA, Channel Four. I want to thank the people of Uganda, who helped this film have a spirit. And finally, I want to thank my mom and my dad; I want to thank my wife Keisha, my children, my ancestors who continue to guide my steps, and God, God who believes in us all and who's given me this moment in this lifetime that I will hopefully carry to the end of my lifetime into the next lifetime. Thank you.

2006,79,Rachel Weisz,Actor in a Supporting Role,Little Miss Sunshine,Alan Arkin,"ALAN ARKIN:
 I know you're not supposed to read but I'd be totally incoherent if I didn't. It's handwritten, it's short.

 More than anything I am deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth and connection. Acting for me has always been and always will be a team sport. I cannot work at all unless I feel a spirit of unity around me. So my main sense of gratitude goes to the entire cast and crew and production team of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for creating the same sense of joy and trust and community that the film speaks about.

 I'd like to thank the Academy, Fox Searchlight, my wife Suzanne, my sons Adam, Matthew and Tony for their endless support. My representation: Estelle, Lee, Frank and Melody. And for the great teachers I've had throughout my life, both in and out of the profession. Thank you very much.

I want to share my gold star with my fellow nominees, those brilliant, brilliant actresses who gave such amazing performances this year. I also share my gold star with the filmmakers: with Stephen Frears, with Peter Morgan, with Andy Harries, and all the producers and all the filmmakers and the cast. Thank you.

 Now, you know for fifty years and more Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty and her hairstyle. She's had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head, her handbag on her arm and she's weathered many, many storms.

Thank you very much.

She was my biggest inspiration for everything because she was a singer, and she had the passion for it but she never had the chance, and that was the thing that pushed me forward to continue. But I'm so grateful to have my mother here celebrating with me. My boyfriend, my sisters and my brothers back home, and then I've got two of them here, thank you all for being here and supporting me. Also I'd like to thank Bill Condon, our director, who's a genius. Wow. Oh my God. Unbelievable cast. I'd like to thank the Academy. Definitely have to thank God, I guess, again. I can't believe this. Wow, I don't know what to say but I thank you all for helping me keep the faith even when I didn't believe. Thank you and God bless you all. [Music begins] Jennifer Holliday, too!

 I'm looking at this gorgeous thing that you've given me and I'm thinking back to the first devilish whisper of an idea that came to him and everything since and it seems to me that this sprang like a golden sapling out of the mad, beautiful head of Paul Thomas Anderson. I wish my son and my partner, HW Plainview, were up here with me, the mighty Dillon Freasier. So many people to thank. One amongst them would be Mrs. Plainview, down there, the enchantingly optimistic, open-minded and beautiful Rebecca Miller. I hope that all those to whom I owe and to whom I feel the deepest gratitude will forgive me if I say just simply: Thank you, Paul.

 I've been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and I'd like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Michael Balcon; my father, Cecil Day Lewis; and my three fine boys, Gabriel, Ronan and Cashel. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you.

I want to share this with the cast, with the great Tommy Lee Jones, with the great Josh Brolin, with the great Kelly Macdonald.

 And I want to dedicate this to my mother, and I have to say this in Spanish, I'm sorry: Mama, esto es para ti. Esto es para tus abuelos, para tus padres Rafael y Matilde.

 Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns! I did not expect this, but I, and I want it to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often. But I am touched by the appreciation and I hoped for it enough that I did want to scribble down so I had the names, in case you were commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns. And so I want to thank my best friend, Sato Masuzawa. My circle of long-time support: Mara, Bryan, Barry and Bob. The great Cleve Jones. Our wonderful writer, Lance Black. Producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks. And particularly, as all us actors know, our director either has the patience, talent and restraint to grant us a voice or they don't, and it goes from the beginning of the meeting through the cutting room. And there is no finer hands to be in than Gus Van Sant.

 And finally, for those--two last finallies. For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support. We've got to have equal rights for everyone. And there are, and there are these last two things. I'm very, very proud to live in a country that is willing to elect an elegant man president and a country who, for all its toughness, creates courageous artists, and this is in great due respect to all the nominees, but courageous artists who, despite a sensitivity that sometimes has brought enormous challenge, Mickey Rourke rises again and he is my brother. Thank you all very much.

Firstly, I'd like to thank the Academy for recognizing our son's amazing work. Warner Bros. and Christopher Nolan in particular for allowing Heath the creative license to develop and explore this crazy ""Joker"" character. To Steve Alexander, Heath's mentor, special friend and agent for ten years; we love you, Steve. This award tonight would've humbly validated Heath's quiet determination to be truly accepted by you all here, his peers, within an industry he so loved. Thank you.

 Okay, that fainting thing, Penélope. I'd be lying if I haven't made a version of this speech before. I think I was probably eight years old and staring into the bathroom mirror and this [holding up her statuette] would've been a shampoo bottle. Well, it's not a shampoo bottle now! I feel very fortunate to have made it all the way from there to here and I'd like to thank some of the people along the way who had faith in me. My friends and my family, especially my mum and dad, who are in this room somewhere. Dad, whistle or something, 'cause then I'll know where you are. [Loud whistle.] Yeah! I love you!

 I also want to thank Hylda Queally, Dallas Smith and the late, much loved, much missed Robert Garlock. And from Peter Jackson and Emma Thompson to my very own Sam and Stephen Daldry. I'm very lucky to have been given ""Hanna Schmitz"" by Bernhard Schlink and David Hare. And Stephen, working with you is an experience I will never forget. There was no division between the cast and the crew on this film, and that's what made it so special. So, to have been surrounded by a remarkable group of people who provided an unbroken chain of support, from David Kross to Ralph Fiennes, Bruno Ganz, Lena Olin, from hair and makeup to cinematography, from the art department to the ADs, and from New York to Berlin. And I'm so lucky to have a wonderful husband and two beautiful children who let me do what I love and who love me just the way that I am.

 Anthony [Minghella] and Sydney [Pollack], this is for you. This is for both of you. And I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees, these goddesses. I think we all can't believe we're in a category with Meryl Streep at all. I'm sorry, Meryl, but you have to just suck that up! And just to the Academy, thank you so much. My God! Thank you!

 This is not going to be forty-five seconds, I can say that right now. Has anybody ever fainted here? Because I might be the first one.

 Thank you so much to the Academy. I want to share this with my fellow nominees and with the amazing ensemble of actors that I had the privilege to work with in this movie. Thank you, Woody, for trusting me with this beautiful character. Thank you for having written over all these years some of the greatest characters for women. And I cannot talk about great female characters without thanking my friend Pedro Almodóvar for having made me part of so many of his adventures. Thank you, Bigas Luna, Fernando Trueba, for giving me my first two movies. Thank you, Harvey Weinstein. I want to dedicate this to my parents and to my brother and sister, to my friend Robert Garlock, who is not with us anymore, and to everyone who has helped me from the beginning, and you know who you are, and I thank you from my heart.

 I grew up in a place called Alcobendas, where this was not a very realistic dream. And I, always the night of the Academy Awards I stay up to watch the show. And I always felt that this was, that this ceremony was a moment of unity for the world, because art, in any form, is and has been and will always be our universal language and we should do everything we can, everything we can to protect its survival. So I thank you so much and I have to say something in Spanish, because everyone: [A] todos los que desde España ahora estén compartiendo este momento conmigo y sientan que esto también es de ellos, se los dedico. Y a todos los actores de mi país. Muchisimas gracias. Thank you so much.

 Oh! Thank you, Academy members! Mom and Dad, yeah, look! Whoo! Thank you, Mom and Dad, for turning me on to such a groovy profession. Oh, my dad, my mom, they loved show biz so much. I remember my mom getting all of us kids to entertain at her parties, you know, my dad sitting me on his bed and teaching me all of the basics of acting for a role in ""Sea Hunt."" They loved show biz so much and I feel an extension of them, you know, this is honoring them as much as it is me.

 I wanna thank Scott Cooper, our wonderful director, for his knowledge of film and country music, and for his ability to instill self-confidence in his actors. I thank you for that, Scott. Where are you? Raise your hand, man. Yeah! Scotty! Thank you for that, Scott man! And thank you for assembling such a wonderful cast. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin, wherever he is backstage, and Bobby Duvall. So wonderful, you guys brought your heart and soul. I want to thank Barry Markowitz, our wonderful DP, did such a brilliant job. Judy Cairo, our producer, and Fox Searchlight, our wonderful distributor. Thank you, guys, for keeping us all together and for making it all happen. T Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton, for bringing all of that great music and those wonderful musicians to the party, man. And my wonderful team that's kept me together: Jean Sievers, David Schiff, Rick Kurtzman at CAA, Bob Wallerstein, Loyd Catlett, Tarra Day and Roger Love, man. Thank you, guys.

 And I especially want to thank my gorgeous wife, Sue. We've been married thirty-three years. We have a beautiful family, three girls: Isabelle, Jessie and Hayley. Thank you, guys. I wouldn't be up here without you. Thank you so much.

 Oscar and Penélope, that's an über bingo.

 I always wanted to discover some new continent and I thought I had to go this way. And then I was introduced to Quentin Tarantino who was putting together an expedition that was equipped by Harvey Weinstein and Lawrence Bender and David Linde. And he put this script in front of me and he said, ""This is where we're going, but we're going the other way."" So Brad Pitt helped me on board and Diane Kruger was there. And Mélanie Laurent and Denis Menochet and Bob Richardson, Sally Menke, and Adam Schweitzer and Lisa Kasteler. And everybody helped me find a place. Universal and The Weinstein Company and ICM. And Quentin, with his unorthodox methods of navigation, this fearless explorer took this ship across and brought it in with flying colors. And that's why I'm here. And this is your welcoming embrace, and there's no way I can ever thank you enough. But I can start right now: Thank you.

 Did I really earn this or did I just wear you all down? I would like to thank the Academy for allowing me in the last month to have the most incredible ride, with rooms full of artists that I see tonight and that I've worked with before and I hope to work with in the future, who inspire me and blaze trails for us. Four of them, that I've fallen deeply in love with, I share this night with and I share this award with. Gabby, I love you so much. You are exquisite. You are beyond words to me. Carey, your grace and your elegance and your beauty and your talent makes me sick. Helen, I feel like we are family, through(?) family, and I don't have the words to express just what I think of you. And Meryl, you know what I think of you, and you are such a good kisser.

 I have so many people to thank for my good fortune in this lifetime, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I know. To the family that allowed me to play them, the Tuohy family. I know they're in here and you'll probably hear her in a minute... Maybe not. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different: John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you. To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago. I'm still holding a grudge.

 But there's so many people to thank; not enough time. So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from. Those moms and parents never get thanked. I, in particular, failed to thank one. So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do. For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be. She said to be an artist you had to practice every day. And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else. We are all deserving of love. So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep. Thank you.

 First, I would like to thank the Academy for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics. I want to thank Miss Hattie McDaniel for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to. Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, because you touched it the whole world saw it. Ricky Anderson, our attorney of Anderson & Smith, thank you for your hard work. My entire BET family, my ""Precious"" family, thank you so much. To my amazing husband Sidney, thank you for showing me that sometimes you have to forgo doing what's popular in order to do what's right. And baby, you were so right. God bless us all.

2010,83,Sandra Bullock,Actor in a Leading Role,The King's Speech,Colin Firth,"COLIN FIRTH:
 I have a feeling my career has just peaked. My deepest thanks to the Academy. I'm afraid I have to warn you that I'm experiencing stirrings, somewhere in the upper abdominals, which are threatening to form themselves into dance moves which, joyous as they may be for me, it would be extremely problematic if they make it to my legs before I get offstage. So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude.

 First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this. All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are. Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be. And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen: Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation.

 And all the people who have been rooting for me back home. Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones. And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this. And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family. And Livia, for putting up with my fleeting delusions of royalty and who I hold responsible for this, and for really everything that's good that's happened since I met her. Now, if you'll all excuse me I have some impulses I have to tend to backstage. Thank you very much [unintelligible].

Russell, what a great spirit, you know, on the set. Just, just fantastic. And thank you so much, mate, for making the work that all of us actors did actually mean something, you know? I mean, that's the director's job of translating it to the audience and making it mean something. Thank you for that. Thank you to Pamela Martin, likewise, as our editor. The just incredible work of every actor. Melissa – I'm not gonna drop the f-bomb like she did; I've done that plenty before – Amy, Jack, Mark, man, you know the guy who just got this whole thing going right from the get go.

 Everybody in Lowell, all the actors from there. Dicky and Micky. Where's my quacker? Is he up there? Dicky's up there somewhere, mate. [Dicky Eklund stands up and waves from the audience.] Eh, mate, you're the best! You're the best. I can't wait – and listen, he's had a wonderful story and I can't wait to see the next chapter of his story, you know? If you wanna, if you wanna be a champ, if you wanna get trained with him, go meet with him. Dickeklund.com. Go do it. Check him out, okay. Alright. He deserves it.

 Our producers: Mark, David, Todd, incredible. Relativity and Paramount, for just pushing this out there and letting people know it exists. So many movies are just brilliant but nobody ever knows about them, you know? So we're so lucky to be here tonight and have people recognize that. My team, led by Patrick and Boomer and Carlos and Jen and Anna and Julie, thank you so much for everything you do. And of course, mostly, my wonderful wife... [chokes up] I didn't think I was like this! [Unintelligible] my wonderful wife, who's my mast through the storms of life.

I am so grateful to get to do the job that I do. I love it so much. I want to thank my parents, who are right there, first and foremost for giving me my life and for giving me the opportunity to work from such an early age, and showing me every day how to be a good human being by example.

 And I want to thank my team who works with me every day. Aleen Keshishian, my manager for eighteen years. And my agents, Kevin Huvane and everyone at CAA. Bryna and Tamar at I/D. My friends, who are everything to me no matter what's going on in my career. And everyone who's ever hired me: Luc Besson, who gave me my first job when I was eleven years old; Mike Nichols, who has been my hero and my champion for the past decade; and now Darren Aronofsky. You are a fearless leader, a visionary. I am blessed to have just gotten to get to work with you every day for the period of time we did.

 So many people helped me prepare for this role. Mary Helen Bowers spent a year with me, training me. Michelle Rodriguez, and Kurt Froman, and Olga Kostritzky, Marina Stavitskaya, and my beautiful love, Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the film and has now given me my most important role of my life. And also there are people on films that no one ever talks about that are your heart and soul every day. Margie and Geordie, who did my hair and makeup; Nicci, who dressed me; and Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who designed the beautiful ballet costumes. Joe Reidy, our incredible AD, first AD. And our camera operators, J.C. and Steve, you gave me so much soul behind the camera every day and you gave me all of your energy. Most importantly, my family, my friends, and my love. Thank you so much.

Thank you so much, opening your hearts to all of us to make this film. I thanked David, I'll thank him again. My family, my beautiful son who's traveling right now in South America and can't join me. It's okay; I'm okay, Jack. My mom and my dad, and my brother, and my friends, and my family. And I wanna thank the very most of all, the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences, their board of governors and all their members, whom many of you are here today.

Tickets cost five dollars and it lasted fifteen minutes. Times have changed. So thank you, Douglas Fairbanks. Yes, Melissa, your grandfather's spirit and joie de vivre inspired me for this role. And so many of you here tonight have inspired me. Thank you, Michel. Thank you for this incredible gift. Thank you, my wonderful partner, Bérénice Bejo. Thank you, the wonderful cast and crew.

 [To the Oscar:] You're only two years older than me, darling. Where have you been all my life?

 I have a confession to make. When I first emerged from my mother's womb, I was already rehearsing my Academy thank you speech. But it was so long ago, mercifully for you I've forgotten it. But I haven't forgotten who to thank. The Academy, of course, for this extraordinary honor. And my fellow nominees: Kenneth, Nick, Jonah, dear Max. I'm so proud to be in your company. Of course I wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for Michael Mills and his enchanting film, ""Beginners."" And my screen partner, of course, Ewan McGregor, that superb artist who I would happily share this award with if I had any decency -- but I don't. All the producers at Olympus Films, especially Leslie Urdang and Miranda de Pencier. All the people at Focus, for their tremendous generosity and support. And not to mention my, haha, little band of agents provocateurs: Lou Pitt and his wife Berta, Carter Cohn, Pippa Markham, Perry Zimel, who've tried so hard to keep me out of jail. My daughter Amanda, who always makes me proud. And lastly, my long-suffering wife, Elaine, who deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for coming to my rescue every day of my life. Thank you so much.

 First I'm going to thank Don, because when you thank your husband at the end of the speech they play him out with the music, and I want him to know that everything I value most in our lives you've given me. And now secondly, my other partner. Thirty-seven years ago, my first play in New York City, I met the great hairstylist and makeup artist Roy Helland. And we worked together pretty continuously since the day we clapped eyes on each other. His first film with me was ""Sophie's Choice,"" and all the way up to tonight when he won for his beautiful work in ""The Iron Lady"" thirty years later. Every single movie in between. And I just want to thank Roy, but also I want to thank -- because I really understand I'll never be up here again. I really want to thank all my colleagues, all my friends. I look out here and, you know, I see my life before my eyes: my old friends, my new friends. And really, this is such a great honor, but the thing that counts the most with me is the friendships and the love and the sheer joy we have shared making movies together. My friends, thank you, all of you, departed and here, for this, you know, inexplicably wonderful career. Thank you so much. Thank you.

 I really don't know how any of this happened. I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that ""Lincoln"" shouldn't be a musical.

 My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago – or since we got married sixteen years ago – my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men. I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she's the versatile one in the family and she's been the perfect companion to all of them. I'd like to thank Kathy Kennedy, our producer, and through you, Kathy... and through you, our mighty team of co-conspirators. At the apex of that human pyramid there are three men to whom I owe this and a great deal more: Tony Kushner; our beloved skipper Steven Spielberg; and the mysteriously beautiful mind, body and spirit of Abraham Lincoln. For my mother. Thank you so much.

I thank Harvey Weinstein and Amy Pascal, Stacey Sher, Reginald Hudlin and Pilar Savone. I thank Adam Schweitzer, Lisa Kasteler. And I thank my friends Jeff Dashnaw and Bill Clark who saved my neck.

 We participated in a hero's journey – the hero here being Quentin. And you scaled the mountain because you're not afraid of it. You slay the dragon because you're not afraid of it.

2013,86,Jennifer Lawrence,Actor in a Leading Role,Dallas Buyers Club,Matthew McConaughey,"MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY:
 Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.

 There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, ""When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.""

 To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.

 And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, ""Who's your hero?"" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, ""Who's your hero?"" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, ""So, are you a hero?"" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, ""Why?"" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.

 So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you.

 Incredible. Ellen, I love you. To my fellow nominees, I'm so proud to share this journey with you. I'm in awe and have so much respect for you all. To the Academy, thank you.

 In 1971, Bossier City, Louisiana, there was a teenage girl who was pregnant with her second child. She was a high school dropout and a single mom, but somehow she managed to make a better life for herself and her children. She encouraged her kids to be creative, to work hard and to do something special. That girl is my mother, and she's here tonight. And I just want to say, I love you, Mom. Thank you for teaching me to dream. To my brother, Shannon, the best big brother in the world, you're a true artist. Thank you so much for sharing this insane and amazing adventure that is Thirty Seconds to Mars, and for being my best friend. I love you. Thank you.

 To all the dreamers out there around the world watching this tonight in places like the Ukraine and Venezuela, I want to say, we are here. And as you struggle to, to make your dreams happen, to live the impossible, we're thinking of you tonight. And this is incredibly special as well, because there's so many people that helped me get here. And I just want to say thank you to Focus Features, to Mick Sullivan, to Jim Toth, to Jason Weinberg, to Emma Ludbrook, to Callie Addams, to the entire ""Dallas Buyers Club"" team. Matthew, I love you. Jean-Marc.

 And this is for the 36 million people who have lost the battle to AIDS. And to those of you out there who have ever felt injustice because of who you are or who you love, tonight I stand here in front of the world with you and for you. Thank you so much and goodnight.

 Sit down; you're too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis. From you it exacerbates this honor to it and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary – yet again – extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in ""American Hustle"" blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.

 And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that ""Blue Jasmine"" stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!

 Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of ""Blue Jasmine,"" I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in ""Blue Jasmine,"" I thank you so much.

 And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on ""Blue Jasmine,"" it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia, and Michael Wilkinson and CM and I are just tonight's tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you.

 Yes! Thank you to the Academy for this incredible recognition. It doesn't escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is thanks to so much pain in someone else's. And so I want to salute the spirit of ""Patsey"" for her guidance. And for Solomon, thank you for telling her story and your own.

 Steve McQueen, you charge everything you fashion with a breath of your own spirit. Thank you so much for putting me in this position; it has been the joy of my life.

My brother Junior, sitting by my side, thank you so much. You are my best friend. And Ben, my other best friend, my chosen family. When I look down at this golden statue, may it remind me and every little child that no matter where you're from your dreams are valid. Thank you.

 Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the Academy. I don't think I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now. Please know this, I am fully aware that I am a lucky, lucky man. This, this Oscar... wow! This Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world battling ALS. It belongs to one exceptional family: Stephen, Jane, Jonathan and the Hawking children. And I will be its custodian. And I will promise you I will look after him – I will polish him; I will answer his beck and call; I will wait on him hand and foot. But I would not be here were it not for an extraordinary troupe of people. My staggering partner in crime, Felicity Jones. My ferocious and yet incredibly kind director, James Marsh. Working Title, Focus, Lisa and Anthony, Nina, and my ingenious team of Dallas, Josh, Gene, Jason, Elan, Carl*, Britney* and Carrie and Pip. Now, finally, please, this is so extraordinary.

Joe and Olivia, you are extraordinary human beings. Smart, funny, kind, loving people, and that's because you are a reflection of your mother.

 And if I may, call your mom, everybody. I've told this [to] like a billion people or so. Call your mom, call your dad. If you're lucky enough to have a parent or two alive on this planet, call 'em.

 Thank you so much. I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer. If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.

 I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did. And finally, for my husband Bart and our children, Cal and Liv, thank you for my life, thank you for giving me a home. Thank you very much for this.

 Thomas and Paul, thank you for giving me my beautiful children. Enzo and Harlow, you're the deepest people that I know. My friends who all work so hard to make this world a better place.

To my heroes, volunteers and experts who have helped me bring ecological sanitation to the developing world with GiveLove.org. To every woman who gave birth.

2015,88,Julianne Moore,Actor in a Leading Role,The Revenant,Leonardo DiCaprio,"LEONARDO DiCAPRIO:
 Thank you. Thank you all so very much. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances. ""The Revenant"" was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. First off, to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tom Hardy. Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen. To Mr. Alejandro Iñárritu, as the history of cinema unfolds you have forged your way into history these past two years. What an unbelievable talent you are. Thank you to you and Chivo for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us. Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency, in particular Arnon Milchan. You were the champion of this endeavor. My entire team. I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career. Mr. Caton-Jones, for casting me in my first film. Mr. Scorsese, for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To Mr. Rick Yorn, thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. And to my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly; you know who you are.

 And lastly, I just want to say this. Making ""The Revenant"" was about man's relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity. For the indigenous people of the world. For the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this. For our children's children. And for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much.

2015,88,Patricia Arquette,Actor in a Supporting Role,Bridge of Spies,Mark Rylance,"MARK RYLANCE:
 I've always, I've always just adored stories. Hearing them. Seeing them. Being in them. So for me to have the chance to work with, I think, one of the greatest storytellers of our time, Steven Spielberg, has just been such an honor. And unlike some of the leaders we're being presented with these days, he leads with such love that he's surrounded by masters in every craft on this film. Every craft. Not the least, Mr. Tom Hanks. People... I'm so pleased that our film has been nominated so many times, and as a face of the film I meet many people in the streets. And it's lovely to have them, they're always saying to me, ""would it help?"" and all that stuff. And I think if you ever wondered about acting with Tom Hanks, would it help? The answer's clearly yes.

 I want to just say thank you to my fellow nominees. I don't know how they separate my acting from your glorious acting in these wonderful films that you're in, which everyone must see. I don't know how they separated the five of us from all the other supporting actors who are making films at the moment. It's a wonderful time to be an actor and I'm proud to be part of it. Thank you.

I'd like to thank A24 for taking this movie into their hands and sharing it with the world. I'd like to thank our director Lenny Abrahamson, who is absolutely incredible.

And to all the other nominees, you did great work. I'm proud to be in your company. You guys are very brave and I admire what you do. I'm only here, really, because of all the talents and goodwill of so many people; they're impossible to name. But most of all Kenneth Lonergan, who made this part, and without this part and without his writing I wouldn't be here for sure. And well, he directed it. Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say, but I'm just, I'm really proud to be a part of this community in general. I look out at all of you, I have this whole year, and I'm just dumbfounded that I'm included. It means a lot to me. Thank you also to Matt Damon for creating this opportunity.

And one thing that they consistently told me – Zelda Fichandler, Ron Van Lieu, Ken Washington – is that it wasn't about you. It's not about you. It's about these characters. You are a servant, you're in service to these stories and these characters, and I'm so blessed to have had an opportunity. It was about ""Juan."" It was about ""Chiron."" It was about ""Paula."" The cast and crew was just such a wonderful experience. Thank you, Barry Jenkins. Thank you, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Adele Romanski, who forced Barry to cast me. [Laughs.] No, but it's just such a wonderful experience and I have so many people to thank who've gotten me here. My manager Carolyn Govers, who I've been with for 10 years. Just thank you so much.

It's such a gift getting to work with you and be inspired by you and the performances that you all offered up. So thank you, the Academy. Really appreciate this.

People ask me all the time, ""What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"" And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here's to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.

 And to Bron Pictures, Paramount, MACRO, Todd Black, Molly Allen, Scott Rudin for being the cheerleaders for a movie that is about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness and grace. And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I've ever worked with. And, ""O captain, my captain,"" Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.

 And to Dan and Mae Alice Davis, who were the, and are the center of my universe. The people who taught me, good or bad, how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose. My parents. I'm so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world. To my sisters. My sister Deloris, who's here, who played Jaji and Jaja with me. We were rich white women in the tea party games.

I've lived in America for the longest time and I am deeply grateful to her for the loves and the friendships I have made and the many wonderful gifts it has given me: my home, my livelihood, my family and now Oscar.

That kid was, he was struggling with his identity, trying to figure himself out. And I think to anyone struggling with theirs and trying to discover their voice, listen, we made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life just unapologetically himself. And the fact that I'm celebrating him and this story with you tonight is proof that we're longing for stories like this. I am the son of immigrants from Egypt. I'm a first generation American and part of my story is being written right now, and I could not be more grateful to each and every one of you, and everyone who believed in me for this moment.

 To be standing here representing one of the greatest artists of our time, James Baldwin, it's a little surreal. James Baldwin birthed this baby and Barry, you nurtured her, you surrounded her with so much love and support. So it's appropriate for me to be standing here, 'cause I'm an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone. Mom, I love you so much. Thank you for teaching me that God is always leaning, always has been leaning, in my direction. G'moses(?). They'll ask me about that later. Um, so many people to thank. Chelsea Barnard, who brought this project to Annapurna. Megan Ellison. Annapurna. Plan B. This amazing cast. My sisters in art: Marina, Amy, Emma, Rachel.

2019,92,Olivia Colman,Actor in a Leading Role,Joker,Joaquin Phoenix,"JOAQUIN PHOENIX:
 God, I'm full of so much gratitude right now. And I do not feel elevated above any of my fellow nominees, or anyone in this room, because we share the same love, the love of film. And this form of expression has given me the most extraordinary life. I don't know what I'd be without it. But I think the greatest gift that it's given me, and many of us in this room, is the opportunity to use our voice for the voiceless. I've been thinking a lot about some of the distressing issues that we are facing collectively. And I think at times we feel, or were made to feel, that we champion different causes. But for me, I see commonality. I think, whether we're talking about gender inequality, or racism, or queer rights, or indigenous rights, or animal rights, we're talking about the fight against injustice. We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender, or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.

 I think that we've become very disconnected from the natural world. And many of us, what we're guilty of is an egocentric worldview, the belief that we're the center of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth we steal her baby even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. And then we take her milk that's intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. And I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up. But human beings at our best are so inventive and creative and ingenious, and I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.

 Now I have been, I have been a scoundrel in my life. I have been selfish. I have been cruel at times, hard to work with, and ungrateful, but so many of you in this room have given me a second chance. And I think that's when we're at our best. When we support each other. Not when we cancel each other out for past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow. When we educate each other. When we guide each other toward redemption. That is the best of humanity. When he was 17, my brother wrote this lyric, he said: Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow. Thank you.

 Wow. Thank you. This is incredible, really incredible. Thank you to the Academy for this honor of honors. They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week. I'm thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it; in the end the adults do the right thing.

 This [holding up the Oscar] really is about Quentin Jerome Tarantino. You are original. You are one of a kind. The film industry would be a much drier place without you. And I love the ethos you gave ""Cliff Booth"": Look for the best in people – expect the worst – but look for the best. Leo, I'll ride on your coattails any day, man; the view's fantastic. And to the rest of the cast and crew; big, bad Bob Richardson; Robert Garcia; Richie; my man Mike Moh. And you know, I also want to say, you know, while we're doin' all this, I think it's time we give a little love to our stunt coordinators and our stunt crews. Listen, I'm a bit gobsmacked. I'm not one to look back but this has made me do so. And I think of my folks taking me to the drive-in to see ""Butch and Sundance,"" and loading up my car and moving out here, and Geena and Ridley giving me my first shot, to all the wonderful people I've met along way to stand here now. Once upon a time in Hollywood, ain't that the truth? This is for my kids who color everything I do; I adore you. Thank you.

 Thank you to the Academy. Thank you for inviting me here alongside one of the most special collaborations and meaningful experiences of my life. I've said it before and I'm gonna to say it again. Cynthia, Scarlett, Charlize, Saoirse, I have to say, boy, it is an honor to be considered in your company.

 David Livingstone, Cameron McCracken, director Rupert Goold, boy, it was a privilege to work with you and I feel so proud to be in your beautiful movie. I gotta thank my stage moms: Matt, Anna, Geoff and Eric Vetro, Paul, Gary. Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock, Rufus Sewell, all the cast and the crew who worked so hard on this film to celebrate Judy Garland. My extended family at CAA: Peter, Bryan and Kevin. Imprint: Nicole and Dom. Nanci Ryder, thank you for the 25 years. John Carrabino, my handsome date of 25 years, thank you for always dreaming bigger than I would dare and for bringin' it back to the work and joy and gratitude. My immigrant folks, who came here with nothin' but each other and a belief in the American dream, how about this? Thank you to you. Big brother Drew, Brandy, Judy, Stone and Ava, for all the love, all the love and support possible that makes you believe anything is possible.

 And I have to say that this past year of conversations celebrating Judy Garland across genders and – I'm sorry – across generations and across cultures has been a really cool reminder that our heroes unite us. You know, the best among us who inspire us to find the best in ourselves. You know, when they unite us, when we look to our heroes, we agree. And that matters. Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, Delores Huerta, Venus and Serena, and Selena, Bob Dylan, Scorsese, Fred Rogers, Harriet Tubman. We agree on our teachers and we agree on our courageous men and women in uniform who serve. We agree on our first responders and firefighters. And when we celebrate our heroes we're reminded of who we are as one people, united. And though Judy Garland did not receive this honor in her time, I am certain that this moment is an extension of the celebration of her legacy that began on our film set. And is also representative of the fact that her legacy of unique exceptionalism and inclusivity and generosity of spirit, it transcends any one artistic achievement. Miss Garland, you were certainly among the heroes who unite and define us, and this is certainly for you. I am so grateful. Thank you so much, everybody. Good night.

 Ah, man. Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who was one of the most, the strongest, most delicate people I've ever met. I got to protect Saniyya and Demi, the two actresses that played Venus and Serena. I'm being called on in my life to love people, and to protect people, and to be a river to my people. Now, I know to do what we do you gotta be able to take abuse, you gotta be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business you gotta be able to have people disrespecting you and you gotta smile and you gotta pretend like that's okay. But Richard Williams, and what I loved -- thank you, D. Denzel said to me a few minutes ago, he said: At your highest moment, be careful; that's when the devil comes for you. It's like, I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena -- I just spit; I hope they didn't see that on TV. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That's what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern.

 I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment, and I'm not, I'm not crying for winning an award. It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine light on all of the people -- Tim and Trevor and Zach and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue and the entire cast and crew of ""King Richard."" And Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father just like they said... I look like the crazy father just like they said about Richard Williams. But, love will make you do crazy things. To my mother -- a lot of this moment is really complicated for me -- but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She had her knitting friends. She has a knitting crew that she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother and my family, my wife -- I'm taking up too much time. Thank you for this honor.

 This is amazing to be here on this journey. I cannot believe I'm here. Thank you so much to all the members of the Academy for recognizing my work. It's really amazing that our film, ""CODA,"" has reached out worldwide. It even reached all the way to the White House. And they invited the cast of ""CODA"" to visit and have a tour of the White House and we met President Joe and Dr. Jill, and I was planning on teaching them some dirty sign language but Marlee Matlin told me to behave myself. So don't worry, Marlee, I won't drop any F-bombs in my speech today.

 Instead, I really want to thank all of the wonderful deaf theater stages where I was allowed and given the opportunity to develop my craft as an actor. Thank you. I read one of Spielberg's books recently, and he said that the best director, the definition of the best director was a skilled communicator. Siân Heder, you are the best communicator. And the reason why is you brought the deaf world and the hearing world together, and you are our bridge. And your name will forever be on that bridge, Siân Heder Bridge, here in Hollywood. And that was supported by Apple, Sundance, all our cast, our crew, our producers, and the community of Gloucester, Massachusetts. So I just want to say: Hey, fisherman. Hey, Popeyes. Don't forget to eat your spinach.

 My dad, he was the best signer in our family. But he was in a car accident and he became paralyzed from the neck down, and he no longer was able to sign. Dad, I learned so much from you. I'll always love you. You are my hero. Thank you to my biggest fans: my wife and my daughter Kyra, and my hometown of Mesa, Arizona, and Mark Finley, my manager, and our team. I just wanted to say that this is dedicated to the deaf community, the CODA community, and the disabled community. This is our moment. To my mom, my dad and my brother Mark -- they're not here today, but look at me now. I did it! I love you. Thank you.

I definitely would not be up here right now, I probably wouldn't even have a career, if it wasn't for Hylda Queally, Paul Nelson, Steve Warren and Nicole Perna. I love you guys; thank you very much. I just have to say your guys's names because I love you. Kristen, Nicole, Penélope, Olivia, I love guys so much, and to be included in the conversation with you is such an honor. I have to thank Michael Showalter, my director, who created a space that inspired creativity and love and courage.

I have to thank David Greenbaum, Matthew Greenfield, all of Searchlight, for shepherding our film. My scene partner and collaborator, Andrew Garfield -- the brilliant Andrew Garfield. Thank you so much for bringing out the best in me by showing up every day with the best of you. Thank you.

 And right now we are coming out of some difficult times that have been filled with a lot of trauma and isolation. And so many people out there feel hopelessness and they feel alone. And suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. It's touched many families; it's touched mine. And especially members of the LGBTQ community, who oftentimes feel out of place with their peers. There is -- we're faced with discriminatory and bigoted legislation that is sweeping our country with the only goal of further dividing us. There's violence and hate crimes being perpetuated on innocent civilians all over the world. And in times like this I think of Tammy, and I'm inspired by her radical acts of love. We've talked about love a lot tonight. And I'm inspired by her compassion and I see it as a guiding principle that leads us forward. And it connects us all in the desire that we want to be accepted for who we are, accepted for who we love, and to live a life without the fear of violence or terror. And for any of you out there who do in fact feel hopeless or alone, I just want you to know that you are unconditionally loved for the uniqueness that is you. Mio tesoro, Giulietta, Augustus. You are my heart. And I thank you all very, very much. Thank you.

 If I took the time to say thank you to every single beautiful person who has lifted me up on this stage you'd find people would be sitting here until next Oscars, so I'm not going to do that. But just allow me to say that it was the summer of a lifetime and I am the most privileged and grateful to have spent it with all of you.

So, lastly, imagine this little girl in the backseat of a white Ford Focus. Look into her eyes. You see a queer, openly queer, woman of color, an Afro-Latina, who found her strength in life through art. And that's what I believe we're here to celebrate. Yeah! Yeah!

Thanks, Erica, thank you very much. And I'm just gonna say this. My entertainment lawyer, Tom Hansen, of 40 years, the half of which he spent trying to get me insured and bailing me out of the hoosegow: Thanks, bro! Avri, Exton, Indio, this one's for you.

 Oh, boy. [Turning around to show the back of her dress:] My dress has broken. I think it happened during [pointing to Ryan Gosling in the audience] ""I'm Just Ken."" I'm pretty sure. Oh, boy, this is really, this is really overwhelming. Sorry, I -- hmm. Okay. My voice is also a little gone. Whatever! The women on this stage, you are all incredible. And the women in this category -- Sandra, Annette, Carey, Lily -- I share this with you. I'm in awe of you and it has been such an honor to do all of this together. I hope we get to keep doing more together. I don't know what I'm saying. Oh my god, I'm totally -- okay.

 The other night I was panicking, as you can kind of see, happens a lot, that maybe something like this could happen. And Yorgos said to me, Please take yourself out of it. And he was right. Because it's not about me. It's about a team that came together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. And that is the best part about making movies, is all of us together. And I am so deeply honored to share this with every cast member, with every crew member, with every single person who poured their love and their care and their brilliance into the making of this film. And, Yorgos, thank you for the gift of a lifetime in ""Bella Baxter."" I am forever thankful for you. Thank you for inviting all of us to be members of this team. Thank you.

 [Applause starts up.] And I just -- oh, wait. I just -- I know I have to wrap up, but I really just want to thank my family. My mom. My brother, Spencer. My dad. My husband, Dave. I love you so much. And most importantly, my daughter, who's gonna be three in three days and has turned our lives technicolor. I love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl. So thank you so much. Don't look at the back of my dress. Thank you.

 God is so good. God is so good. You know, I, I didn't think I was supposed to be doing this as a career. I started off as a singer and my mother said to me, Go across that street to that theater department, there's something for you there. And I thank my mother for doing that. I thank you to all the people who have stepped in my path and has been there for me, who has ushered me and guided me. I am so grateful to all you beautiful people out here. For so long I've always wanted to be different, and now I realize I just need to be myself. And I thank you, I thank you for seeing me.

 Ron Van Lieu, I thank you. When I was the only black girl in that class, when you saw me and you told me I was enough. And when I told you, I don't see myself. You said, That's fine; we're going to forge our own path. You're going to lay a trail for yourself. I'm so grateful to all the women who have been by my side: Colleen Camp, Barbara Broccoli, Tracy Brennan, Sarah Fargo. I have to give a special shout-out to my publicist -- and I know y'all said don't say nothin' about no publicist. But you don't have a publicist like I have a publicist! You have been by my side for the entire thing, and I am forever grateful.

 I pray to God that I get to do this more than once. I thank you for seeing me. Have a blessed night. Thank you so much.
